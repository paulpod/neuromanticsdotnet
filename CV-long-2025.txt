PAUL POD 
CURRICULUM VITÆ – 2025
Introduction

Designer of three of the most used online public services: NHS 111, Tax your vehicle, and Check MOT history, each with tens of millions of users probably including you.

Most recently I was a contract interaction designer with Defra / Environment agency, and before that I was at the NHS as interaction designer with the product team on the 111 online service.

Through COVID and the aftermath it was a hectic and demanding role. That was my second tour of duty with NHS Digital, and right before that I was designing a mobile app for start-up crowdfunder Seedrs.

Previously I worked on a range of innovation projects at Telefonica Digital covering mobile, internet of things, retail and other curious subjects. I’ve also done a range of design roles at startups and larger organisations.

With my own startups, Artfinder and TIOTI.com, I was co-founder and took an idea from sketch through prototype, into production through launch and beyond. Both receiving angel round funding at first, following up with a successful series A VC funded round. Tioti was acquired by Vizimo in 2008, Artfinder continues today. 

GOV.UK, GDS and NHS digital experience, also open to designing non-gov related products, services and also music tech / startup curious.

Makes prototypes: I prefer making things to drawing pictures of things. Variety over specialism. Quick and dirty over finished and polished. Learn. Repeat. Learn. Repeat. This is what Design means in agile.

Sept 2024 – Oct 2025 : Defra / Environment Agency
Design for water licensing.

Working as Interaction Designer I joined the WRLS team in September 2024. The initial brief was to design a replacement for an existing 1990s database frontend with a more modern GOV.UK service, redesigning data entry into a more user friendly process that won’t require months of training to use correctly.

This was followed by designing a way for users of the existing online Licensing Service to investigate previous versions of licences, tracing changes across the history of a water resource.

- Designing in code: building prototypes for user research
- Working on a speculative pitch to replace the entire end-to-end wider licensing system
- Wew UI and userflows to investigate history, changes and versions of licences
- Improving the overall service with new navigation

Sept 2020 – Sept 2024 : NHS 111 Online
Design for urgent and emergency healthcare in a pandemic.

As Interaction Designer I joined the 111 online team in September 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in full flow. My initial job was to add booking functionality for patients requiring an A&E visit, with all the complications that can raise. As a new concept for people to understand, it was throughly prototyped and researched with users.

Following that I worked on frequent improvements to the 111 online service as the pandemic progressed - from alerts around mink, travellers from Denmark, using pulse oximeters on “virtual wards”, through information about vaccines and vaccination side effects. By 2023 we worked on returning the 111 online service to business as normal, with new features.

- Adapting 111 online to apply the NHS design system
- Adding images, sounds and video to improve triage questions
- Updating user flows to detect, ask and confirm location
- Improving less urgent outcomes: dentists, opticians, midwifery
- Designing ways to deliberately and very vaguely tell people about callback times
- Better ways to let people tell us their location
- Sorting out edge cases around showing accurate opening and closing times
- Improving access to mental health services

In addition, I spent most of 2023 working on a more inclusive way to ask people their sex before starting a triage. Fascinating work with deep user research. 

In this role I mentored young designers and contributed to the NHS design system.


June 2019 – April 2020: Seedrs
User research, design & prototyping a mobile app for this crowdfunding platform using Framer X.

2016: Gain Capital / Design Lead (UX)
As the Lead Designer I was brought in to kickstart a dramatic refresh of retail trading platforms.
