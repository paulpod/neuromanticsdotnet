Hello, my name is Paul and this is my intermittent blog, apologies if you expect something more regular. I do that on [Twitter as @paulpod](http://twitter.com/paulpod "@paulpod on Twitter") or on [Flickr as paulpod](http://flickr.com/paulpod "Flickr photos"). 

I'm a designer, my [portfolio is here http://SP1.ME](http://sp1.me "My Portfolio") and this is my [Linkedin profile](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/paulpod "Paulpod on Linkedin"). 

I've done a few things: 
Worked for brilliant design agencies including Razorfish v1, Poke and BERG. Started a small digital design boutique called Neuromantics with clients like Nokia, BBC and Vodafone. 

Bootstrapped a “social media for TV” startup called TIOTI which was later angel and VC funded and acquired by Vizimo. [Startup history](https://techcrunch.com/2007/10/21/tioticom-wins-seven-figures-from-pond/)

Been a co-founder of a much larger startup called Artfinder which for a while was all about making something with interesting people and content. Those experiences informed the mildly popular [Lessons learnt from doing startups](http://www.neuromantics.net/blog/?p=327 "Lessons learnt doing startups") post. 

Done future digital strategy and product design, innovation prototype _“stuff”_ for EMI Music, Money Advice Service and Telefonica Digital. 

Spent a year and a half as a head of design at the DVLA, working with the Government Digital Service (GDS). 

Designed a HTML trading platform from scratch, and other freelance things in London, commuting from Wales.

Now doing design of digital services for the NHS. 

I used to live in London and feel a tiny bit responsible for ridiculous Shoreditch. Escaped the city to a small rural village in North Oxfordshire to keep bees. Then went mad and moved to a smallholding in furthest, darkest South Wales with sheep, chickens and lots of trees. Still here.
