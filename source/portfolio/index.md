2020-now / NHS 111 online
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I joined the 111 online team in September 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in full flow. My initial job was to add booking functionality for patients requiring an A&E visit, with all the complications that can raise. As a new concept for people to understand, it was throughly prototyped and researched with users.

Following that I have been working on frequent improvements to the 111 online service as the pandemic progressed - from alerts around mink, travellers from Denmark, using pulse oximeters on "virtual wards", through information about vaccines and vaccination side effects. Now in 2023 we're working on returning the 111 online service to business as normal.

* adapting 111 online to apply the NHS design system
* adding images, sounds and video to improve triage questions
* updating user flows to detect, ask and confirm location
* improving less urgent outcomes: dentists, opticians, midwifery
* designing ways to _very vaguely_ tell people about callback times
* better ways to let people tell us their location
* sorting out edge cases around opening and closing times


[![Where we got to with asking a users sex, where relevant, and clarifying body parts ahead of a specific triage pathway](/images/sex-screens.png)](/images/sex-screens.png) 

I've spent most of the past 6 months working on a more inclusive way to ask people their sex before starting a triage. Fascinating work with deep user research. Iâ€™ve written up some of the work from 2022 in my [Year Note post](/2022/12/31/year-note-2022/)

2019-20 / Seedrs
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I mostly worked on designing a mobile app for Seedrs users. I've used Framer X to make a number of high fidelity, deep prototypes as well as conducting user research to design the right thing.

[![A few screens from the app](/portfolioimg/seedrs-app.png)](/portfolioimg/seedrs-app.png)

* contributing towards a design system for Seedrs
* redesigning and simplifying the payment flows
* reworking a login flow more appropriate for mobile native users

2017-19 / NHS Digital, Urgent and Emergency Care
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I have worked on products for healthcare professionals to access and improve the Directory of Services, a piece of core national infrastructure that allows patients to be referred to the most appropriate service for their condition, location and urgency.

[![Service Finder partial flow](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-01.png)](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-01.png)

* applying NHS/GOV.UK design guidelines as appropriate
* user research with a range of healthcare professionals
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, JQuery, SASS, etc

**Things:** I work in multidisciplinary teams that deliver live products to real users - Paramedics and Pharmacists, 999 and 111 operators.

* Profile Updater (fixing data about services) 
* Service Finder (searching for services) 

[![Service Finder screens](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-02.jpg)](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-02.jpg)

Service Finder is a tool for a wide range of healthcare professionals in a wide range of settings to look for the most appropriate service to send a patient. This can mean a paramedic or district nurse visiting a non-urgent patient using the mobile implementation, or a pharmacist or 999 non-emergency callback operator using the large screen version.

I have written up a comprehensive exploration of the [search design that is central to Service Finder here.](https://neuromantics.net/2019/02/16/search-for-nhs-digital/)

Profile Updater is a tool that allows service operators (in the first iteration, pharmacies) to update the central NHS directory of services with their opening times and the specific patient services they offer. 


2017 / Department for International Trade
===============================
As the **Lead Designer** I worked on a part of the GREAT campaign website that was intended to handle enquiries about inward investment. Unfortunately due to the realities around Brexit, there were few user needs we could actually meet, so the project was cancelled.

* applying deep user research to personas, segmentation
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, SASS, HTML, CSS


2016 / Fjord + Unilever
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I worked on a small innovation project to prototype a chatbot to relieve pressure on HR teams attending to frequently asked questions and tasks for employees.

* flows and scripts for chatbot interaction
* prototyping using PullString, Skype Bots, Messenger Bots

Here's a slightly cheesy video about it.

2016 / Gain Capital, City Index
===============================
As the **Lead Designer** I was brought in to kickstart a dramatic refresh of retail trading platforms. The existing flash-based platform had an end of life on the horizon, and moving to a new HTML5 technology stack provided the opportunity to bring user-centred design principles to the problem.

* applying deep user research to personas, segmentation
* create new design guidelines
* helping improve internal design capability
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, JQuery, HTML, CSS

[![Gain Capital Screens](/portfolioimg/gaincap-pics.png)](/portfolioimg/gaincap-pics.png)

**Things:** I made a Gain Capital design guide and prototyping kit. We explored and prototyped a range of trading interfaces, covering expert to beginner levels of experience.

2014-15 / Government Digital Service @ DVLA
===========================================
As the **Head of Design** my brief was to help teams at the DVLA in Swansea create and improve world-class digital public services.

[![DVLA montage](/portfolioimg/dvla-pics.jpg)](/portfolioimg/dvla-pics.jpg)

* content design: less is usually more
* apply & adapt design guidelines and best practice
* helping build internal design capability
* prototyping using GOVUK toolkits : NodeJS, SASS, HTML, CSS
* mentoring and training civil service interaction designers

**Things:** I made a DVLA specific style guide and quickstart design kit. A large proportion of the work was continuous iteration of prototypes for Vehicle Tax and other services. The live service is at [www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax](http://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax) and handles over 40 million transactions a year.

Yeah, that's my registration used as the example on a bunch of the services, like [Checking the MOT status](https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-status) and others.

2013-14 / Telefonica Digital, Innovation Lab
==============================================
As a **Senior Interaction Designer** in a small group we worked on short, sharp projects to explore cutting edge technologies and new product ideas, supported by an exceptional developer team. Some of the subject areas were:

Big Data & Personal Data
------------------------
Originating use cases, prototyping digital identity products, user research.

Exploring the usefulness and user interest in a wide variety of **'data-locker'** functions and scenarios.

We built prototypes covering digital documents and ID, personal shopping assistants, email concierge and more.

We trialed technologies like Passbook and OCR, email proxy servers and web browser extensions.

Scenarios were then introduced to users, with a gradual increase in utility vs intrusiveness and responses were recorded. Results were interesting!

Local Social
------------
Exploring service design ideas around socialised Wifi, community mediated services at village scale ahead of 4G rollout.

As a micro-sized exploration of the Smart Cities meme, identifying and applying everyday digital tech to the unique problems and scenarios around a tiny population.

Physical UX
---
I worked with a small team designing and implementing the electronics on Android IOIO boards for a 'screenless' messaging prototype aimed at the elderly and digitally excluded. 

Earlier extensive user research and simple prototypes by the talented Barcelona team had validated the concept, and our ambitious three month brief was to get a consumer beta product + service into shops by Christmas.

[![RadioMe montage](/portfolioimg/radiome-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/radiome-montage.jpg)

The promotional site was ~~is at [www.getaradiome.com](http://www.getaradiome.com)~~

{% endraw %}



[![RadioMe photos](/portfolioimg/radiome-photos.jpg)](/portfolioimg/radiome-photos.jpg)

It was a short fun project, for me, going from zero to coding and soldering working prototypes in a few weeks but the work from the Barcelona team in bringing it to market, even in a limited form, was amazing.

Digital Retail Analytics
------------------------
Indoor positioning, iBeacons, Passbook â€” location-based digital loyalty.

With new technology like indoor positioning, mobile device and wide area consumer surveillance the acceptance and adoption by users and the general population requires compelling and realistic use-cases that benefit everyone.

[![Retail montage](/portfolioimg/retail-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/retail-montage.jpg)

This work attempts to design improved services through this mix of potentially intrusive methods, balanced with covenience and rewards for consumers.

[![Retail dashboards](/portfolioimg/retail-dashboards.jpg)](/portfolioimg/retail-dashboards.jpg)

Alongside, we were working with live installed store tracking technologies and developed a range of data dashboards to visualise this traffic.

2012 / LabGuru / Biodata / Digital Science
===
I was brought in as a remote consulting designer to attempt a rationalisation of the UI and other elements in a laboratory management service.

[LabGuru design guide LabGuru design guide](/lg/guide/index.html)
As a fast growing Israel-based startup, Biodata had added features and views in an organic, agile way by the team. Over time these old and new elements had become complex and inconsistent.

Without the scope for a complete redesign, we opted for a rational tidy up and a refresh of the visual language. The work is presented here as a set of guidelines.


2012 / Money Advice Service
===
I created a strategy and vision video, prototyping and explaining future concepts for board level discussion as to how and where the Money Advice Service could leverage their unique position in the financial sector.

I followed this with a refreshed brand identity for digital use and art directed a series of consumer facing information videos for financial concepts, such as auto-enrolment pensions.

2010-2012 / Artfinder
===
As part of the founding team, I had a head of product / design role.

[![Artfinder montage](/portfolioimg/artfinder-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/artfinder-montage.jpg)

Artfinder was a website, phone and tablet platform bringing art into the digital age. Our first steps were around collating a decent sized catalogue and providing cultural institutions with digital superpowers.

[![Artfinder UI montage](/portfolioimg/artfinder-ui-montage.png)](/portfolioimg/artfinder-ui-montage.png)

[Collected screens - single PDF](/portfolioimg/artfinder-for-portfolio.pdf)

We followed this with by enhancing the real world experience using image recognition, location based services around events and exhibitions.

[![Artfinder events UI montage](/portfolioimg/artfinder-events-ui-montage.png)](/portfolioimg/artfinder-events-ui-montage.png)

I also designed a wide array of iPad apps as the digital version of coffee table books, and experimented with ebooks and ibooks as a simpler medium for this. Below is a video prototype (After Effects) exploring some of the native iPad interactions.

I created a strategy for a sustainable, authentic and eco-focused print and framing business for Artfinder, [You Want to Buy a Woodland?](/portfolioimg/artfinder-woodland.pdf) for consideration as we closed Series A investment.

</div>
{% endraw %}

EMI were trying to get a handle on the shift to digital music, and part of the strategy was to make digital deluxe box-sets. Something deep and immersive, that could wrap up an artist's entire discography and archive in a living, mostly online product with exclusivity and quality. Quite difficult, it turns out vs the commodification of music, digitally. 

[![EMI Lava design doc](/portfolioimg/emi-lava.png)](/portfolioimg/emi-lava.pdf)

Here's a fun [PDF of the design overview for these products](/portfolioimg/emi-lava.pdf) - they could be wide or deep, depending on the artist and content available.

One full-size product was released based on these concepts before EMI Music was acquired by Universal in 2011. It used terrific archive material of John Lennon for this, a capture of some of the site is here.

I guess it looks a bit rough these days but it was developed in 2010 and was intended to be web native rather than locking into apps, with the limitations that creates.

Love this bit of work we did for the BBC: concepting a future TV _cloud_ around suggestions, recommendations, social TV traces of what your friends might have been watching. Two years before iPlayer launched.
