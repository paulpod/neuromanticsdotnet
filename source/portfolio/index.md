So, extensive GOV.UK, GDS and NHS digital experience. But! I am open to *designing non-gov related* products, services and also music tech curious. I have worked in most areas - fintech (including trading), music, internet TV, telcos and have a digital agency background.

**Makes prototypes:** I prefer making things to drawing pictures of things. Variety over specialism. Quick and dirty over finished and polished. 

Learn. Repeat. Learn. Repeat. This is what Design means in agile.

2024-25 / Defra / Environment Agency
===============================
Water Resources Licensing Service
---------------
Working as **Interaction Designer** I joined the WRLS team in September 2024. The initial brief was to design a replacement for an existing 1990s database frontend with a more modern GOV.UK service, redesigning data entry into a more user friendly process that won’t require months of training to use correctly.

Also, an opportunity arose to pitch an alternative to the vast MS Dynamics-based strategic programme, so quickly worked with a small team to create a speculative solution for that:

[![Sample screens from part of the flow for our speculative end-to-end licence application service](/images/screens-for-wrls-pitch.png)](/images/screens-for-wrls-pitch.png) 

This was followed by designing a way for users of the existing online Licensing Service to investigate previous versions of licences, tracing changes across the history of a water resource.

* designing in code: building prototypes for user research
* working on a speculative pitch to replace the entire end-to-end wider licensing system
* new UI and userflows to investigate history, changes and versions of licences
* improving the overall service with new navigation

2020-24 / NHS 111 online
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I joined the 111 online team in September 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in full flow. My initial job was to add booking functionality for patients requiring an A&E visit, with all the complications that can raise. As a new concept for people to understand, it was throughly prototyped and researched with users.

Following that I worked on frequent improvements to the 111 online service as the pandemic progressed - from alerts around mink, travellers from Denmark, using pulse oximeters on "virtual wards", through information about vaccines and vaccination side effects. In 2023 we worked on returning the 111 online service to business as normal, with new features.

* adapting 111 online to apply the NHS design system
* adding images, sounds and video to improve triage questions
* updating user flows to detect, ask and confirm location
* improving less urgent outcomes: dentists, opticians, midwifery
* designing ways to deliberately and  _very vaguely_ tell people about callback times
here is a video about this piece of [work from the show and tell](https://youtu.be/vvYfO8RH_cI) at the time
* better ways to let people tell us their location
* sorting out edge cases around opening and closing times
* improving access to mental health services

[![Where we got to with asking a users sex, where relevant, and clarifying body parts ahead of a specific triage pathway](/images/sex-screens.png)](/images/sex-screens.png) 

I spent most of 2023 working on a more inclusive way to ask people their sex before starting a triage. Fascinating work with deep user research. I’ve [written up some of the work from 2022 in my Year Note post](/2022/12/31/year-note-2022/) which covers this sex question as well as improving how to determine a users location in all circumstances.

[![Images were added to the triage that had come from a telephony-based service](/images/111-images-flank.png)](/images/111-images-flank.png) 

I wrote a bit about how we [researched and added images](/2023/06/26/adding-images-to-111-online/) to 111 online, while keeping the highest standards of accessibility and diversity.

[![A few notes from the darkmode exploration](/portfolioimg/nhs111-darkmode-montage.png)](/portfolioimg/nhs111-darkmode-montage.png)

In this role I mentored young designers and contributed to the NHS design system. 

Here I [wrote up a series of explorations on dark mode](https://neuromantics.net/2025/11/17/dark-mode-for-nhs-111/) for the NHS design system.

2019-20 / Seedrs
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I mostly worked on designing a mobile app for Seedrs users. I've used Framer X to make a number of high fidelity, deep prototypes as well as conducting user research to design the right thing.

[![A few screens from the app](/portfolioimg/seedrs-app.png)](/portfolioimg/seedrs-app.png)

* contributing towards a design system for Seedrs
* redesigning and simplifying the payment flows
* reworking a login flow more appropriate for mobile native users

2017-19 / NHS Digital, Urgent and Emergency Care
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I have worked on products for healthcare professionals to access and improve the Directory of Services, a piece of core national infrastructure that allows patients to be referred to the most appropriate service for their condition, location and urgency.

[![Service Finder partial flow](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-01.png)](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-01.png)

* applying NHS/GOV.UK design guidelines as appropriate
* user research with a range of healthcare professionals
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, JQuery, SASS, etc

**Things:** I work in multidisciplinary teams that deliver live products to real users - Paramedics and Pharmacists, 999 and 111 operators.

* Profile Updater (fixing data about services) 
* Service Finder (searching for services) 

[![Service Finder screens](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-02.jpg)](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-02.jpg)

Service Finder is a tool for a wide range of healthcare professionals in a wide range of settings to look for the most appropriate service to send a patient. This can mean a paramedic or district nurse visiting a non-urgent patient using the mobile implementation, or a pharmacist or 999 non-emergency callback operator using the large screen version.

I have written up a comprehensive exploration of the [search design that is central to Service Finder here.](https://neuromantics.net/2019/02/16/search-for-nhs-digital/)

Profile Updater is a tool that allows service operators (in the first iteration, pharmacies) to update the central NHS directory of services with their opening times and the specific patient services they offer.

2017 / Department for International Trade
===============================
As the **Lead Designer** I worked on a part of the GREAT campaign website that was intended to handle enquiries about inward investment. Unfortunately due to the realities around Brexit, there were few user needs we could actually meet, so the project was cancelled.

[![Where to invest, mobile flows](/portfolioimg/dit-wheretoinvest.png)](/portfolioimg/dit-wheretoinvest.png)

* applying deep user research to personas, segmentation
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, SASS, HTML, CSS

2016 / Fjord + Unilever
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I worked on a small innovation project to prototype a chatbot to relieve pressure on HR teams attending to frequently asked questions and tasks for employees. The service was platform agnostic and used MS language services to create a smarter text-input branching structure - Choose your own HR adventure.

[![Example chat flow](/portfolioimg/una-sick-flow.png)](/portfolioimg/una-sick-flow.png)

* flows and scripts for chatbot interaction
* prototyping using PullString, Skype Bots, Messenger Bots

Here's a slightly cheesy video about it.

2016 / Gain Capital, City Index
===============================
As the **Lead Designer** I was brought in to kickstart a dramatic refresh of retail trading platforms. The existing flash-based platform had an end of life on the horizon, and moving to a new HTML5 technology stack provided the opportunity to bring user-centred design principles to the problem.

* applying deep user research to personas, segmentation
* create new design guidelines
* helping improve internal design capability
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, JQuery, HTML, CSS

[![Gain Capital Screens](/portfolioimg/gaincap-pics.png)](/portfolioimg/gaincap-pics.png)

**Things:** I made a Gain Capital design guide and prototyping kit. We explored and prototyped a range of trading interfaces, covering expert to beginner levels of experience.

2014-15 / Government Digital Service @ DVLA
===========================================
As the **Head of Design** my brief was to help teams at the DVLA in Swansea create and improve world-class digital public services. As well as an overall design leadership role, I was lead designer on the popular *Tax your vehicle* service.

[![DVLA montage](/portfolioimg/dvla-pics.jpg)](/portfolioimg/dvla-pics.jpg)

* helping with content design: less is usually more
* lead designer on Tax your vehicle
* apply & adapt design guidelines and best practice
* helping build internal design capability
* prototyping using GOVUK toolkits : NodeJS, SASS, HTML, CSS
* mentoring and training civil servants into interaction designers

**Things:** I made a DVLA specific style guide and quickstart design kit. 

A large proportion of the work was continuous iteration of prototypes for Vehicle Tax and other services. The live service is at [www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax](http://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax) and handles over 40 million transactions a year.

Yeah, that's my registration used as the example on a bunch of the services, like [Checking the MOT status](https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-status) and others.

2013-14 / Telefonica Digital, Innovation Lab
==============================================
As a **Senior Interaction Designer** in a small group we worked on short, sharp projects to explore cutting edge technologies and new product ideas, supported by an exceptional developer team. Some of the subject areas were:

Big Data & Personal Data
------------------------
Originating use cases, prototyping digital identity products, user research.

Exploring the usefulness and user interest in a wide variety of **'data-locker'** functions and scenarios.

We built prototypes covering digital documents and ID, personal shopping assistants, email concierge and more.

We trialed technologies like Passbook and OCR, email proxy servers and web browser extensions.

Scenarios were then introduced to users, with a gradual increase in utility vs intrusiveness and responses were recorded. Results were interesting! There was an appetite for understanding the exchange of data and privacy for better prices and services. 

*New* This work was in 2013 but I have noticed that tools in the augemented shopper space are reaching the market so have [written a new blog post about this work](/2024/08/23/Revisiting-digital-mediated-shopping/) in a modern context.

Physical UX
---
I worked with a small team designing and implementing the electronics on Android IOIO boards for a 'screenless' messaging prototype aimed at the elderly and digitally excluded. 

Earlier extensive user research and simple prototypes by the talented Barcelona team had validated the concept, and our ambitious three month brief was to get a consumer beta product + service into shops by Christmas.

[![RadioMe montage](/portfolioimg/radiome-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/radiome-montage.jpg)

The promotional site was ~~is at [www.getaradiome.com](http://www.getaradiome.com)~~

[![RadioMe photos](/portfolioimg/radiome-photos.jpg)](/portfolioimg/radiome-photos.jpg)

It was a short fun project, for me, going from zero to coding and soldering working prototypes in a few weeks but the work from the Barcelona team in bringing it to market, even in a limited form, was amazing.

Digital Retail Analytics
------------------------
Indoor positioning, iBeacons, Passbook — location-based digital loyalty.

With new technology like indoor positioning, mobile device and wide area consumer surveillance the acceptance and adoption by users and the general population requires compelling and realistic use-cases that benefit everyone.

[![Retail montage](/portfolioimg/retail-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/retail-montage.jpg)

This work attempts to design improved services through this mix of potentially intrusive methods, balanced with covenience and rewards for consumers.

[![Retail dashboards](/portfolioimg/retail-dashboards.jpg)](/portfolioimg/retail-dashboards.jpg)

Alongside, we were working with live installed store tracking technologies and developed a range of data dashboards to visualise this traffic.

2012 / LabGuru / Biodata / Digital Science
===
I was brought in as a remote consulting designer to attempt a rationalisation of the UI and other elements in a laboratory management service.

[LabGuru design guide](/lg/guide/index.html)
As a fast growing Israel-based startup, Biodata had added features and views in an organic, agile way by the team. Over time these old and new elements had become complex and inconsistent.

Without the scope for a complete redesign, we opted for a rational tidy up and a refresh of the visual language. The work is presented here as a design system with html smaple code as well as usage guidelines.

As part of the founding team, I had a head of product / design role.

[![Artfinder montage](/portfolioimg/artfinder-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/artfinder-montage.jpg)

Artfinder was a website, phone and tablet platform bringing art into the digital age. Our first steps were around collating a decent sized catalogue and providing cultural institutions with digital superpowers.

[![Artfinder UI montage](/portfolioimg/artfinder-ui-montage.png)](/portfolioimg/artfinder-ui-montage.png)

[Collected screens - single PDF](/portfolioimg/artfinder-for-portfolio.pdf)

We followed this with by enhancing the real world experience using image recognition, location based services around events and exhibitions.

[![Artfinder events UI montage](/portfolioimg/artfinder-events-ui-montage.png)](/portfolioimg/artfinder-events-ui-montage.png)

I also designed a wide array of iPad apps as the digital version of coffee table books, and experimented with ebooks and ibooks as a simpler medium for this. Below is a video prototype (After Effects) exploring some of the native iPad interactions.

EMI were trying to get a handle on the shift to digital music, and part of the strategy was to make digital deluxe box-sets. Something deep and immersive, that could wrap up an artist's entire discography and archive in a living, mostly online product with exclusivity and quality. Quite difficult, it turns out vs the commodification of music, digitally. 

[![EMI Lava design doc](/portfolioimg/emi-lava.png)](/portfolioimg/emi-lava.pdf)

Here's a fun [PDF of the design overview for these products](/portfolioimg/emi-lava.pdf) - they could be wide or deep, depending on the artist and content available.

One full-size product was released based on these concepts before EMI Music was acquired by Universal in 2011. It used terrific archive material of John Lennon for this, a capture of some of the site is here.
