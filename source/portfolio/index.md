2017-19 / NHS Digital, Urgent and Emergency Care
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I have been working on products for healthcare professionals to access and improve the Directory of Services, a piece of core national infrastructure that allows patients to be referred to the most appropriate service for their condition, location and urgency.

[![Service Finder partial flow](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-01.png)](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-01.png)

* applying NHS/GOV.UK design guidelines as appropriate
* user research with a range of healthcare professionals
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, JQuery, SASS, etc

**Things:** I work in multidisciplinary teams that deliver live products to real users - Paramedics and Pharmacists, 999 and 111 operators.

* Profile Updater (fixing data about services) 
* Service Finder (searching for services) 

[![Service Finder screens](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-02.jpg)](/portfolioimg/nhs-servicefinder-02.jpg)

I'm writing up a comprehensive exploration of the [search design that is central to Service Finder here.](https://neuromantics.net/2019/02/16/search-for-nhs-digital/)


2017 / Department for International Trade
===============================
As the **Lead Designer** I worked on a part of the GREAT campaign website that was intended to handle enquiries about inward investment. Unfortunately due to the realities around Brexit, there were few user needs we could actually meet, so the project was cancelled.

* applying deep user research to personas, segmentation
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, JQuery, SASS, Git, Heroku, HTML, CSS


2016 / Fjord + Unilever
===============================
As **Interaction Designer** I worked on a small innovation project to prototype a chatbot to relieve pressure on HR teams attending to frequently asked questions and tasks for employees.

* flows and scripts for chatbot interaction
* prototyping using PullString, Skype Bots, Messenger Bots


2016 / Gain Capital, City Index
===============================
As the **Lead Designer** I was brought in to kickstart a dramatic refresh of retail trading platforms. The existing flash-based platform had an end of life on the horizon, and moving to a new HTML5 technology stack provided the opportunity to bring user-centred design principles to the problem.

* applying deep user research to personas, segmentation
* create new design guidelines
* helping improve internal design capability
* prototyping using toolkits : NodeJS, JQuery, SASS, Git, Heroku, HTML, CSS

[![Gain Capital Screens](/portfolioimg/gaincap-pics.png)](/portfolioimg/gaincap-pics.png)

**Things:** I made a Gain Capital design guide and prototyping kit. We explored and prototyped a range of trading interfaces, covering expert to beginner levels of experience.

2014-15 / Government Digital Service @ DVLA
===========================================
As the **Head of Design** my brief was to help teams at the DVLA in Swansea create and improve world-class digital public services.

[![DVLA montage](/portfolioimg/dvla-pics.jpg)](/portfolioimg/dvla-pics.jpg)

* content design: less is usually more
* apply & adapt design guidelines and best practice from across government
* helping build internal design capability
* prototyping using GOVUK toolkits : NodeJS, SASS, Git, Heroku, HTML, CSS
* mentoring and training civil service interaction designers

**Things:** I made a DVLA specific style guide and quickstart design kit. A large proportion of the work was continuous iteration of prototypes for Vehicle Tax and other services. The live service is at [www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax](http://www.gov.uk/vehicle-tax) and handles over 40 million transactions a year.


2013-14 / Telefonica Digital, Innovation Lab
==============================================
As a **Senior Interaction Designer** in a small group we worked on short, sharp projects to explore cutting edge technologies and new product ideas, supported by an exceptional developer team. Some of the subject areas were:

Big Data & Personal Data
------------------------
Originating use cases, prototyping digital identity products, user research.

Exploring the usefulness and user interest in a wide variety of **'data-locker'** functions and scenarios.

We built prototypes covering digital documents and ID, personal shopping assistants, email concierge and more.

We trialed technologies like Passbook and OCR, email proxy servers and web browser extensions.

Scenarios were then introduced to users, with a gradual increase in utility vs intrusiveness and responses were recorded. Results were interesting!

Local Social
------------
Exploring service design ideas around socialised Wifi, community mediated services at village scale ahead of 4G rollout.

As a micro-sized exploration of the Smart Cities meme, identifying and applying everyday digital tech to the unique problems and scenarios around a tiny population.

Physical UX
---
I worked with a small team designing and implementing the electronics on Android IOIO boards for a 'screenless' messaging prototype aimed at the elderly and digitally excluded. 

Earlier extensive user research and simple prototypes by the talented Barcelona team had validated the concept, and our ambitious three month brief was to get a consumer beta product + service into shops by Christmas.

[![RadioMe montage](/portfolioimg/radiome-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/radiome-montage.jpg)

The promotional site was ~~is at [www.getaradiome.com](http://www.getaradiome.com)~~

[![RadioMe photos](/portfolioimg/radiome-photos.jpg)](/portfolioimg/radiome-photos.jpg)

It was a short fun project, for me, going from zero to coding and soldering working prototypes in a few weeks but the work from the Barcelona team in bringing it to market, even in a limited form, was amazing.

Digital Retail Analytics
------------------------
Indoor positioning, iBeacons, Passbook â€” location-based digital loyalty.

With new technology like indoor positioning, mobile device and wide area consumer surveillance the acceptance and adoption by users and the general population requires compelling and realistic use-cases that benefit everyone.

[![Retail montage](/portfolioimg/retail-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/retail-montage.jpg)

This work attempts to design improved services through this mix of potentially intrusive methods, balanced with covenience and rewards for consumers.

[![Retail dashboards](/portfolioimg/retail-dashboards.jpg)](/portfolioimg/retail-dashboards.jpg)

Alongside, we were working with live installed store tracking technologies and developed a range of data dashboards to visualise this traffic.

Older work

2012 / LabGuru / Biodata / Digital Science
------------------------
I was brought in as a remote consulting designer to attempt a rationalisation of the UI and other elements in a laboratory management service.

[LabGuru design guide LabGuru design guide](/lg/guide/index.html)
As a fast growing Israel-based startup, Biodata had added features and views in an organic, agile way by the team. Over time these old and new elements had become complex and inconsistent.

Without the scope for a complete redesign, we opted for a rational tidy up and a refresh of the visual language. The work is presented here as a set of guidelines.


2012 / Money Advice Service
------------------------
I created a strategy and vision video, prototyping and explaining future concepts for board level discussion as to how and where the Money Advice Service could leverage their unique position in the financial sector.

[![Money Advice Service](http://img.youtube.com/vi/tp3H-_AYAt0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytp3H-_AYAt0)

I followed this with a refreshed brand identity for digital use and art directed a series of consumer facing information videos for financial concepts, such as auto-enrolment pensions.

2010-2012 / Artfinder
------------------------
As part of the founding team, I had a head of product / design role.

[![Artfinder montage](/portfolioimg/artfinder-montage.jpg)](/portfolioimg/artfinder-montage.jpg)

Artfinder was a website, phone and tablet platform bringing art into the digital age. Our first steps were around collating a decent sized catalogue and providing cultural institutions with digital superpowers.

[Collected screens - single PDF](/portfolioimg/artfinder-for-portfolio.pdf)

We followed this with by enhancing the real world experience using image recognition, location based services around events and exhibitions.

I also designed a wide array of iPad apps as the digital version of coffee table books, and experimented with ebooks and ibooks as a simpler medium for this. Below is a video prototype (After Effects) exploring some of the native iPad interactions.

I created a strategy for a sustainable, authentic and eco-focused print and framing business for Artfinder, [You Want to Buy a Woodland?](/portfolioimg/artfinder-woodland.pdf) for consideration as we closed Series A investment.
