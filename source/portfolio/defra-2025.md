Water Resources Licensing Service
---------------
Working as **Interaction Designer** I joined the WRLS team in September 2024. The initial brief was to design a replacement for an existing 1990s database frontend with a more modern GOV.UK service, redesigning data entry into a more user friendly process that won’t require months of training to use correctly.

Also, an opportunity arose to pitch an alternative to the vast MS Dynamics-based strategic programme, so quickly worked with a small team to create a speculative solution for that:

[![Sample screens from part of the flow for our speculative end-to-end licence application service](/images/screens-for-wrls-pitch.png)](/images/screens-for-wrls-pitch.png) 

This was followed by designing a way for users of the existing online Licensing Service to investigate previous versions of licences, tracing changes across the history of a water resource.

* designing in code: building prototypes for user research
* working on a speculative pitch to replace the entire end-to-end wider licensing system
* new UI and userflows to investigate history, changes and versions of licences
* improving the overall service with new navigation

Detailed screens for Licence History
---------------
These screens include a new site-wide navigation, on the left hand side, replacing the limited tabs across the top, and allowing more options.
