Picture the scene. It's about 11.30am. standing in front of a flooded, windswept Other stage at Glastonbury in June 1998 (although the weather was closer to November), brain flooded with cheap speed and unknown halucinogens from the night before. This is the first band on, hardly possible and playing before a tiny battered audience mired in mud. And then this hits, the lyrics talking about aliens, and the rest. I remember where I was when my mind was blown, yes sir.
