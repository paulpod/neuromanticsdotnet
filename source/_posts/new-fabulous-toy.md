We received a nice new toy today - a [Philips Streamium](http://www.streamium.com) (god, that branding team deserve a prize huh?) SL300i. It's quite a faceless little box that sits between your TV and your network and allows you to stream movies (and music and pictures) to the TV. The TV interface is kind of a sub-TiVo or iPod attempt at navigating directories and lists of files. It's certainly not pretty but gets the job done I guess. Ideally I'd like to be able to hack it into something lovely. The server software for OSX is bloody rubbish though. However, after much looking around it works best with [Elgato's Eyeconnect](http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyeconnect) software... and by best i mean it works - every other UPnP (for it is she) server software was \*really\* poor. Hopefully, VLC will get around to being embedded in a server in a future version, ideally offering transcoding so that unsupported media formats can be turned into whatever the box is happy with. Until lazyweb provides such an item it's all still a bit bleeding edge and definitely not ready for prime time in my opinion. But soon...
