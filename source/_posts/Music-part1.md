I'm between jobs, and have had a bit of an itch to scratch regarding music playback technology and how we actually interact with it. The journey has inspired some new ideas that could work towards a new type of music player.

## Music
We love music. When COVID hit [I got into making it](https://neuromantics.net/2020/06/16/music-update/). Most of us love listening to music, sometimes digitally, which used to require a dedicated device and more often than not, is now an app on a more universal device. Maybe you used to [make mixtapes](https://neuromantics.net/mixtapes/), now playlists.

## From physical to digital
The convenience of playing music digitally is considerable. CDs were great, I never fully got into the habit of buying vinyl. So big, fragile and heavy! Although once you accumulate a certain number of CDs you learn they are also big and heavy.

When digital music files appeared in the 90s it was literally a weight off my shoulders. I kept buying CDs for quite a few more years, but being able to move the music on them around freely was a joy.

## Innovation and evolution
Innovation was rapid, and exciting. In the 16-bit era I had played with MOD trackers, and later Winamp, Soundjam and iTunes leapt into the future. The iPod and iPhone trace their lineage directly. These are interesting stories in their own right: [Straight Dope on the IPod's Birth](), Wired

## Holding back the flood
The iTunes music store (and other online platforms for purchasing digital media) was not equally great. It tried to be, the brief had to be "make it easier than copying a file" but also needed [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) to prevent onwards-copying, which leads to squeezing you into a specific player and platform. Not as much fun, and as I understand it was the demand of the major record labels, not the platforms, or artists - as [Steve Jobs made clear](https://web.archive.org/web/20070207234839/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/).

It feels like a fumble of the ideal medium at that point. Streaming came in, and quickly became ubiquitous, rendering the question of a "file" and "copying" meaningless. A link was sufficient. But also, ownership and tending to your files evaporated. Mostly for the good, I think, but the infinite pool of music feels like a loss somehow.

## A parallel evolution: DJ Tech
Meanwhile, a different digital media story was unfolding elsewhere. Less visible but equally innovative. The CDJ was being developed and refined as a tool for DJs to play digital music.

This was a completely separate timeline for me, one I am only now discovering. I think it is relevant.

## Hello again CDs
I did a bit of a house reorganization, and rediscovered all my CDs, caseless, but clean and in a few of those big 100x zipped albums. But, in the move, could I find a working CD player? Apart from a console, no I could not.

OK, I thought, a really good CD player would be super affordable now? Not so much. Not many companies manufacture them, certainly not reputable brands at competitive prices. So eBay was an option, but there's not loads in super condition. Why? Rubber bands and other parts wear out. I can fix stuff, but this sounds fiddly. 

(My dad coincidentally needed a new CD player at the same time, he shopped around and got a Cambridge Audio - it's good, but was still over £300).

## What if CDs, but more fun?
I always prefer things with multiple functions, so when a friend mentioned these little Tascam CD players that can change pitch, tempo and EQ out some frequencies, for learning guitar, vocals - wow, that sounds amazing. https://tascam.jp/int/product/cd-vt2/top

Quite niche, and consequently hard to find. But I had a dim recollection of CDJs being invented in the 90s, and that should offer some of those features. Yes! They can - much more widely available, if pricey. 

Still, eBay rewards patience, and one [bargain CDJ-900 later](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-gb/product/player/archive/cdj-900/black/overview/) I can play, and play with_ CDs again.

## What is old is new
Play _with..._ yeah, interesting. Now, this is a 16 year old CD player for a very specific use case. It does some things I had not realised it would do, and I'm going to describe these from my complete newbie perspective - apologies if this is annoying.

[![It has a lot of buttons](/images/cdj-900-wireframe.png)](/images/cdj-900-wireframe.png)

## Faster, slower, higher, lower
Firstly, it can change tempo, and it would naturally change the pitch like on a record player but also it can change the tempo WITHOUT changing the pitch. I mean obviously that's what drew me to the idea, but this is cool.

## 1, 2, 3, 4 
Plus it can count! It can count the BPM, and the bars and the beats. And listening to the mechanism, it is reading a portion of the track into memory, functioning as a constant sampler I suppose. That allows it to have buttons for instant and seamless loops - 1 bar, 4 bars, 8 etc. There are numerous functions around this, to adjust the in/out points and save loop points to recall them later.

## Push the button
It is of course worth noting that *like the first iPod*, it has a physically moving jog wheel. Connected but separate to that, the platter is a touch sensitive surface, pressure responsive too, with a circular screen in the middle of it. 

A dial controls the response to simulate vinyl with a slowing touch, stop and speed up, or tight and instant, like digital, or somewhere in between. Thoughtful detail.

[![Circular screen](/images/cdj-900-jogscreen.png)](/images/cdj-900-jogscreen.png)

## Round and round
The circular screen in the middle is curious, it's made up of fixed LEDs and does some subtle modal things but mostly provides visual spinning feedback for the placement of a virtual playhead on the record. Which, yes, is the inverse of an actual needle on a stylus, but makes sense I suppose. I think mainly it helps orientate the playhead when scratching.

Yes you can scratch it, like vinyl, and this model has functions to let you do that but return it to the beat, in time (called Slip). It has a USB stick port and there's a chunky screen, and a dial for file browsing playback off that. Lots of buttons, mostly single function. Honestly, it's more like controls on a pre-2010s car, there is no touch screen (which is good). It is built like a tank.

## Connectivity
I have a nice Arcam thing with a DAC running active speakers, so wanted something with digital out. Perfect. As well as the slot on top for a USB stick, this CDJ has a second USB for audio in. What? Yeah, it can work as a sound card,  USB audio out from your laptop. Also it has ethernet. Eh?

And this where things started to get interesting.
