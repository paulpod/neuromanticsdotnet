I have become far too distracted documenting my journey towards some ideas, so let's park that for now and create some designs of a future music player.

## What is the minimum?

OK, so the actual minimum is no visuals, do it all by ear - match the beats of the intro to track two to already playing track one, and mix across. Low tech, high skill. DJ with decks and a simple mixer.

In our post-rekordbox, visual waveform world though? Minimum would be something like track one, with some sort of beat and bar indicator, playing and defining the playhead - the point in time of *now*. Then, a second track being brought in, with a matching visual of these beats, allowing the player to do the matching. As the second track is brought alongside the first, a high pass filter brings in the lower frequencies, and like some magnetic blocks, they *click together* perfectly.

Maybe a little bit like this:

<video controls playsinline width="100%">
	<source src="/images/matching-up.mp4" type='video/mp4' />

{% endraw %}
