Having just ordered a (cheap) graphics tablet from Wacom I'm quite keen to give the whole electronically produced comic a whirl. 

Unfortunately, not being the worlds best figure artist I may need a little help. Which is where Poser comes in. Now at version 5 it can do wonderful things like cloth, great lighting, etc. I may be saved - updates as the project progresses. 

Currently trying out Kung-Log which is pretty nifty. Now listening to **Kids** from the album "Tigermouth" by [Kelli Ali](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Kelli Ali%22). Oooh that was nifty.
