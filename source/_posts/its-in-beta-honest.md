So i got mildly slashdotted [jones-dotted](http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work) today, which is nice. Would have been nice to finish the site first mind, but whatever. 

I still have an awful lot to do on this site yet, most of it browser support and CSS control freakery tweakery. Oh, and I guess some testing on windows wouldn't go amiss. To Do: other templates, the accessibility thang down there, top level nav.

Panther Partition Revisited
---------------------------

Ah, another thing to put on the list of OSX "must never do that": changing the size of partitons when you've got data \*in them\*. I remember doing it a long time ago in the days of SCSI and 2Gb drives, but this was hairier. I was getting my 1Gb Swapfile partiton completely full at times (driving it hard, but even so...) so decided to give it a bit more elbowroom. A dash of imaging and moving about and all sorted again, with that potentially heartstopping moment of resizing passing with ease. This helped: [FWB Partition Toolkit](http://www.fwb.com/html/partition_toolkit.html) but will only reduce partion sizes, so not perfect.
