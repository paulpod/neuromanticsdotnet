Back from a bit of a northern home xmas and so, _so_ glad to be back in London. This city is quite special. Anyway on with the show... I'm reading Neil Postman's [Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140094385/102-5825692-2557710 "
Amazon.com: Books: Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business") at the moment. Although written from a _very_ American point of view and a little out of date (written in 1985 - all very cold war) it is fabulous. We should all read this (actually, most of you probably already have - I'm a little slow) and am eager to discover what might be a similarly good angle to read on the contemporary TV situation and new mediums like the internet. Suggestions? Introductory quote:

> "When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture death is a clear possibility."
