The end is in sight, as is the beginning. One more little freelance gig to go, plus the never ending farce of a _still_ unfinished disney project (want to give me the assets sometime this year guys?) and then all bright and shiny. Sneak

In other news, the facts covered in the Hutton enquiry process but conveniently ignored in the findings are not going away. How inconvenient for Mr blair. Hutton obviously wasn't a coroner and ignored medical advice pointing to the fact that Kelly was unlikely to have committed suicide. In fact he concluded the exact opposite. [Medical evidence does not support suicide by Kelly](http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4856799-103683,00.html) This will be huge, unless it's being suppressed - which it probably is. I knew they done him in, it's classic spy shit.
