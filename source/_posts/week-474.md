Wow, week flew by and it's a saturday weeknote. Good stuff done: a couple of reskinned mockups of our product concept for a couple of rock legends. 

Let me explain in english. I built a mockup of a \*potential\* future product in After Effects. Not having gone through a proper design and prototyping process, it's an impression of a product rather than anything real. Thing is, it looks nice so we use it to show people (artist management usually) the vision and get them to sign up to a shinier, digitally immersive future. 

Luckily, After Effects lets me do a quick reskin per artist fairly quickly now. It's not progressing the product design, but it is building momentum with People Who Matter, which in turn means we'll get to build deeper, better products when the time comes. 

I've started on really working out a mobile version of the above now too, whereas before "mobile" was a couple of boxes and arrows on a diagram, it'll be nice to see what really fits, what needs folding, and what needs reworking completely. 

I may be some time. I also managed to get a few minutes to play with iTunes LP and some HTML5 experiments. The people at [ituneslp.net](http://ituneslp.net) have some great guidance on getting the most of of this platform, usually not using Tunekit and expose a couple of undocumented features like sampling the waveform of the playing audio. 

I couldn't get any processing.js to work but that's more likely my incompetence rather than a major technical hurdle. I did get an opensource asteroids javascript+canvas game to work while playing a suitably themed song, which is immediately 10x more fun than any real iTunes LPs!
