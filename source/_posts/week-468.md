First week back at work and I'm snowed in, along with what sounds like half the country. Still, it cuts down on meetings and focus is going to be priceless this week. My orderly scheme of **Think - Plan - Do** has been upended by needs of the business, so rather than orderly functional workings flowing into wireframes and then into a few polished screens I'm working in a much more finished level, revisiting and iterating as I go as we need to show some solid stuff next week in LA. Part of me hates doing things this way round, but the other half really likes diving in, getting my hands dirty with some pixels. Luckily I had a good few weeks to let the idea really percolate in my brain, so I'm not stumped and changing things round is quick. It'll come out looking good, and this first iteration as a whole might need lots changing before we take a run at a full production project. However, the benefit of everyone involved being able to finally _see something_ long talked about is clear - _excitement_, it builds! The wider economy must be warming up, so I've had to update my linkedin profile with a job title - it's a contract but extremely full-time right now. Future gigs are always considered, but that'll be later in the year thanks.
