The penny in the previous post finally drops with these: [Apple in talks with Intel, WSJ claims](http://go.theregister.com/feed/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/23/apple_intel/) (The Register) and [Steve Jobs announces iTunes to "do" Podcasts](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000027044248/) (Engadget) tickled my imagination into action.

See, if you were to release a really cut down media tablet-PC-style client and video-on-airport-express combo you wouldn't really need a full OS and interface to handle it. You'd probably want something akin to \*ah-ha\* a fixed media-centrist style interface (iTunes) on a tablet touchscreen, a multimedia framework including streaming server, and a robust unix system to run it all. Well, iTunes, Quicktime and Darwin/BSD all run on Intel already, no? Intel does cheap tablet-ideal chips with wifi already, no?

Could this + the resurfaced apple tablet rumours a week ago be the beginnings of a home media centre play by Apple? Looks like it from here. The podcasting element? That's just positioning everything ready for the **_so imminent it bloody hurts_** explosion in IPTV about to keep all us emerging tech/media geeks extremely busy this summer.

**_updated:_** And then I read [the latest Cringely](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050519.html). Ah-ha.

I really can't say any more than a) Neuromantics are going to making some very nice things very soon and b) I might as well pre-beta-soft launch our work in [progress news/analysis/blog thing](http://www.neuromantics.net/news/) here while I can.
