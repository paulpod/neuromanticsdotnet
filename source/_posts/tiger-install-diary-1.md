Again, notes for myself in case I have to come back later (oh, my lack of memory!) as well as potentially useful for anyone else along the way.

Apart from having to jump through a couple of hoops entirely of my own making, install was a breeze, onto the second 250GB drive in the G5. Complete clean install, with no user data being ported across. Reason? I've been working on this G5 for a year now it's just become all a bit messy. Plus with the office getting set up, I want to introduce a bit more structure to our projects, and lay down an associated digital filing system.

First job was getting mail across from entourage. I've been looking forward switching to apple mail, but first import time round proved wildly unsuccessful - a bunch of empty folders. That's no good, we'll try that again later. Next up, get some sync'd data from .Mac down - address book, safari bookmarks and iCal. This works like a dream, although the iSync app is no longer - it's all done through the .Mac preference pane. Haven't tried adding my phone or iPod in yet.

On to Fontbook and hurrah, it really seems a bit more robust than the Panther version and hurrah doesn't move files out of your collection when installing it. So far so good with that then.
