I've been playing around with electronic music again for the past couple of months, and I'm sure I'll write more about that in the next few weeks as it's a lot of fun.

This is a little note, mostly for me incase I forget how to, about how I got my old Yamaha SY35 synth to work with all the modern stuff. For the first time since I bought it in 1996 I've been able to dive into the editing of sounds thanks to a visual sysex editor. I mean, I've had a look because editing a four voice FM synth in a two line 32 character green LCD is not my idea of fun.

New to me is a whole open source(ish) community of editing software for old music hardware at CTRLR.ORG where I found it... unfortunately, the author has made it a Windows .exe but ok. 

So off we go to [fire up a VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

Get a free copy of [Windows 10 from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10), note use Custom install to make it work

I run midi through USB into a [Novation Zero SLMkii so install Automap](https://novationmusic.com/support/product-downloads?product=SL+MkII) too

And run the correct version of the [new SY35 editor from CTRLR.ORG](http://ctrlr.org/sy35-voice-editor/) ...set it up to the correct midi channels... and away we go, live editing of all the parameters (including the hidden ones you can't get from the LCD editor).
