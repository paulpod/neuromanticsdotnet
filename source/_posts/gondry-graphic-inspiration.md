I went to the Michel Gondry retrospective tonight, as part of the[Resfest](http://www.resfest.com/michelgondryretrospective.html "RESFEST 2003") festival at the NFT. 

It was great (obviously) to see his stuff in such a complete and cronological presentation. Especially nice was the inclusion of a few tests and experiments which really helped reveal some of the creative process. 

With Gondry's work so much of the execution relies on taking risks and trying out new techniques. Looking forward to the DVD set by Res, with Spike Jonze and Chris Cunningham too. Hopefully these have even more of these bits and pieces, along with interviews. Amazon wishlist where are you?
