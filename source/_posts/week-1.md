What? I'm hitting the reset button the weeknote counter because technically my extended run of designer-at-large amongst you has come to an end. I've signed an employment contract, have a desk in an actual office and a list of tasks all for one company. 

Shit got real, as I imagine the kids say. We're going to be a wee bit hush for a few weeks yet, but only a few as I think we're looking at three or four products out and proud by end of the year at a minimum. Fast, good, cheap - we picked the first two. 

So I talked about doing some wireframes and mockups for iPad apps before, these are ongoing. In the gaps I've been doing logo designs for company. Man, I forget how hard this stuff is. 

Doing a tweak or refresh of something existing I've done a few of, but from scratch only two or three. You try to conjour up all your hopes, ideas, messages into as few strokes as possible. Oof, proper Hard. It continues. **App of the week:** updated Remote, now for iPad. Pretty nice, playing _this_ tune from _here_ on _that_ thru the _big speakers_ using _this_. Sweet.
