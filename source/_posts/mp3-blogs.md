As [Phil points out](http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2004/06/11/were_gonna_need_.php), MP3 blogs are the current wave of bandwidth destroying fun, and mighty illegal while it lasts. Simple Idea, Great Tool To Deliver It. So, as Bunker hates to be left behind I thought I'd post a link to my monthly (been sending them out via email for a while now) MixTape. There are only a couple of rules i use for my mixtapes - 1) has to fit on a C60 and 2) has to feeature a Smiths cover. I'll, er, keep an eye on the bandwidth, but for now - enjoy!
