Liking the look and the writing of [Guerilla - Ottawa Culture at Ground Level](http://www.getguerilla.ca/). I have fond memories of various time spent in Ottawa in 1997/1998, including the famous [ice storm](http://www.canoe.ca/CNEWSIceStorm/jan18_anatomy1.html) in January 98.

I did some of my most creative work there during a 3 month sabbatical - I was basically burnt out after years of freelancing and could see the coming dot com boom and wanted to be in a better position to embrace it. It worked. I designed 4D typefaces, did great code in lingo, did animated shorts, all on my little G3 laptop.

I'll go back someday...
