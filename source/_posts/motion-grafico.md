Just some nice little motion graphic ideas popping into my head today: 1 ) Seems the net is a little ablaze over the tube map and alternatives. Again. Might be awfully pretty example to do in After Effects layered 3D info-porn. **update:** [here's one](http://www.recenda.f9.co.uk/pages/tubemap.htm) done by someone else, if a bit on the chunky side 2 ) Another thing I need to try out is the physics engine in Carrara (or other 3D app i may have handy). Why? Ah, just had the lovely image of a few hundred loose leaf pages from Preacher or The Invisibles floating down in the wind...
