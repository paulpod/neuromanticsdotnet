Quick round up - all very busy here at Neuromantics what with big, cool projects and an office _and_ flat move soon.

**The Bobs** : We got nominated for another best designed blog award, which is nice. Go and vote for me if you like.

**Podcasting** : An updated, and late, podcast of our mixtape will be out shortly. You can get it early by going to [neuromantics.net/mp3](http://neuromantics.net/mp3)

**T-Shirts** : No, not our long awaited range, but a cool selection over at [Bulletproof T Shirts](http://www.bulletprooftshirts.com/>). Tell them we sent you and I may be able to cover my modesty finally.
