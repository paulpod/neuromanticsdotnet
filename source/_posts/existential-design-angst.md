See, having stepped away from an intense, blinkered three years in a social network startup and having had a brush with mortality, trying to define what to do next has got me a bit stumped. 

As a designer, it's fulfilling to make good things so it'll be along that broad path I think. While doing **visual** stuff is great fun, especially in **motion** graphics and the like, the youngsters seem to have a good deal more energy to put into it than I do just now. 

As design in a more basic sense, there are ideas around that are entering a phase of frantic arrival into reality - these include _ubicomp, spimes, personal informatics_. Massively interesting and important fields that are an inch away from mainstream everyday applications. 

On the other hand, having been involved in a bigger picture for a while, something in the broad field marked **strategy**Â feels a bit more comfortable now, picking up on **trends** such as those mentioned above and fitting them into others from the ground (the street, more correctly) up.
