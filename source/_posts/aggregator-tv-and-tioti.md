[Aggregator](http://www.aggregator.tv), the guys I work for most of the time have finally done their big PR splash, with funding etc. They are doing some really nice stuff along the broadband distribution of TV content, but it's a big job sourcing, licensing, acquiring masters, digitising, DRMing, metadating, selling it and finally delivering. An entirely different proposition to my startup [TIOTI : Tape it off the internet](http://tioti.com) as we are super meta, sitting atop all these rapidly appearing different delivery sites. The more the merrier, and the better for us. We are format and technology agnostic, with no view on the legality of what **you** do to get your media, but obviously cannot condone... blah blah. Either way, TIOTI will probably beat Aggregator to market - couple of weeks for the managed beta 1 - yay!
