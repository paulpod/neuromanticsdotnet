Hello, it's been a while. Let me explain, it's all very simple. BT are fucking idiots who couldn't fulfill broadband demand if their shoddy monopoly relied upon it. My local exchange is apparently "full" and we (me, the adsl supplier, rest of SE1 quite possibly) are waiting for BT to pull corporate thumb from arse and hand down a free port. I remember being on the ADSL trial back in 1998, but clearly this is the _real_ trial. 2 months. 2 bloody months... Fuck you BT.
