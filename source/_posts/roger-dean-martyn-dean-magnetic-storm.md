Grabbing my christmas money I rushed to pick up the sequel book. This has a more practical focus – documenting the publishing company they set up following Views, and all the other desirable books I still chase. 

More ambitious stage design and architectural projects also appear. And even more, every page was pored over. I've never been the same since, and on idle moments in meetings today I will be automatically drawing some twisted tree or rock.
