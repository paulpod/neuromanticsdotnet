[Blogia](http://bellstream.com/blogia/) looks good (available now for Series 60, November for UIQ).

Seems it will plug straight into movabletype (they say typepad, but i think this may mean typepad hosted services only judging by the online [guide](http://bellstream.com/blogia/guidecon.php?t=c&i=001)). Will certainly make pix and audio easy.

I'm still on the search for a mobile compatible (localhost) wikiweb or similar.
