**Plink Art - Visual recognition app for Android phones** Really cool technology seeking a clearly defined application - this builds a visual search around art, letting you identify works from a phonecam snap, and exploring connections from there. ![plinikart-screens](/wpimages/2009/09/plinikart-screens-300x300.jpg "plinikart-screens") 

**BBC Micro Model N** Quick mockup during the interminable nonsense being spouted during a Digital Britain webconf. An modern version of the early 80s push by schools/government/bbc to promote digital skills and tech to the widest possible audience through subsidised hardware, software and broadband access would do more than any of the DB proposals. \[caption id="attachment_184" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="BBC Micro, model N"\]![BBC Micro, model N](/wpimages/2009/09/bbc-micro-model-n-300x260.jpg "bbc-micro-model-n")\[/caption\]
