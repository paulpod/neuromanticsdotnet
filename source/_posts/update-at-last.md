Been very busy recently, what with the bigger job of setting up my new design agency, Neuromantics (yeah I know its the same name, but we're playing a very different game), and migrating to my new main work machine (yes its pretty and very fast). 

As part of the latter I came across a splendid solution to an old probelm I had ignored/avoided for ages - syncing and backing up work. Having a little more at stake now it was about time I took this seriously. 

It was also the first time I had two OSX machines running together full time (the G3 sadly had many flaws at doing this, no airport, no support for the SCSI drive with all my work on, etc). It's been a slick experience up to this point but nothing seemed to do the very simple job I required - sync two "work" directories over the network. 

I tried Retrospect, Folder Synchronise, Tri-Backup and others with only limited success. Then came across a FREE little app that seems to do exactly that with literally no fuss - Synk. Its great, what can I say. Job done, no injuries, everone goes home happy.
