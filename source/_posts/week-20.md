Last note I did a minor reveal of the logo I'd designed for #newstartup, or rather Artfinder. Since then we have quietly come out of the shadows. 

Well not that quietly - [this namecheck in a speech by the arts minister](http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/ministers_speeches/7744.aspx) was slightly unexpected [while this piece in the Observer](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/feb/06/tech-startup-internet-entrepreneurs) was. 

We have a page where you can drop us an email and we'll give you first dibs at our beta, which is extremely soon now. [Artfinder.com](http://artfinder.com) I thought I'd take this weeknote to post some more of the sketches and development as to how we got the logo we settled with. 

(With a little help from Bernie Pochon, great designer trading as [Qualia Lab](http://qualialab.co.uk/) who worked on a bunch of sketches when I got stuck. ) I'm not going to annotate these, suffice to say I got a bit stuck on using frames, quite loved the modern Q ish square one for a while and spent _way_ too long fiddling with an 'rt' ligature.
