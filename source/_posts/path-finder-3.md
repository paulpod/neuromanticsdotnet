The mac based design community is pretty heavy on late switchers to OSX. Whether it's a lack of computing horsepower or simply an unwillingness to jump in and have to relearn an awful lot of skills, this absolute gem of an application makes life much easier. 

Standout features for this designer were the coloured folder and file labels, essential for filing projects; being able to reduce file lists down to crisp 9 pixel geneva; a trashcan on your desktop; customisable keys - apple+N for new folder again, oh joy; preview in column view available when you want, removable when you don't; the absolute killer implementation of a breadcrumb trail along the top of your file listings. 

The latest update, free to try out for 21 days, is a further enhancement of all this. The integration of a tabbed terminal window, or hideable mini terminal below the main window is fantastic for designers who have relearnt some of the previously lost powers. Speed seems improved on the last version, and is now screaming past the unimpressive performance of Apple's own Finder. 

The enhanced preview pane is superb, with PDF support now saving the minute or three Acrobat takes to launch these days. 

How much of this functionality becomes obsolete after the launch of Apple's next major OSX revision, Panther, remains to be seen. But that's not out till nearer the end of the year by the sound of things, and may still not offer the sweet touches and sheer power Path Finder brings so make hay while the sun shines my friends.
