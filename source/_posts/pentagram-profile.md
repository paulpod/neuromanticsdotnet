With the last few official Pentagram books being big collections dominated by the work, the _insights_ into how they work, how the firm is structured and mostly how they _each_ think about design seemed to be airbrushed out of an increasingly corporate picture. 

So maybe to redress the balance, here comes this chunky book of individual interviews with each partner and it more than fills the hole. The distinctive work of partners accompanies each piece too, finally extracting the strands of specialism from the fabric of Pentagramness. 

It is about 2004, and a tiny bit digital emerges, in the form of installation work by Lisa Strausfeld. Revolutionary.

The book photo above tipped off to collect the set. Covetous. You can pick up this fine hardback Phaidon book new or used for very [fair prices from Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0714843776/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0714843776&linkCode=as2&tag=neuromantics-21).
