I will write a bit more about this later, but it looks like my past has caught up with me in the shape of a methodical and well ordered website documenting the Demoscene.

[This is me](https://demozoo.org/sceners/31809/).

This is [Persistence of Vision](https://demozoo.org/groups/31804/), the demo group I used to be in (...and a little bit for [Adrenalin](https://demozoo.org/groups/2147/)) too).
