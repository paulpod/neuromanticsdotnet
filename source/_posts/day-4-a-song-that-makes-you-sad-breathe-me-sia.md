Totally shivers, and I make no apologies for adding this after it was used on the ending on Six Feet Under. I loved that TV show, lots of fun and lots of emotion (for a TV show) and had a great set of characters. This tune swelled on the end sequence showing Claire riding off into the sunset of possible futures. Cheesy, sure, but cheesy magic. Thanks.

_(The original is a bit over played (and banned from embedding by record company idiocy so here's a very lovely Ulrich Schnauss remix)_
