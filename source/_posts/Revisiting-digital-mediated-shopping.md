Here we are again

I will add to this, but it appears that new tools on both sides of the marketplace are emerging both for shoppers to gete better deals and for shops to screw over their customers.

Back in 2013 I looked at an area of work for a "data locker" product for Telefonica. Big data but for the masses, what would make sense. Tiny data, maybe?

On visiting a shopping site, the tool should be able to find voucher codes and offers not normally visible on the store visit.

And do some pre-fetch filtering on each item, based on the sizes actually available. And finally, make sure you are not being over charged for practically identical items available elsewhere.

More to follow, in the light of [dupe.com](https://dupe.com) and the ramping up of an asymettrical information war between shoppers and capitalism. That's not a marketplace, if you cannot discover pricing and are being fooled into non-bargains. Users need new weapons.
