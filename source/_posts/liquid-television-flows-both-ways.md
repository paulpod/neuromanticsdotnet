[Elgato EyeHome](http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyehome&PHPSESSID=e6c882f92886218023607a9687089bb2) \- This is a pretty interesting device for watching downloaded media on your TV. Supports MPEG 1,2,4 DivX and plenty of audio formats which seems more than enough to be useful, all connected to your home network.

It's funny because I'm mostly doing things the other way round, streaming shows from my tivo and watching them in VLC on the second screen on my mac, while working or surfing or whatever. It would be nice to have the choice though.

Add the PSP (September? 180 quid? Just get one from Hong Kong kids!!) into the mix for portable access to my media and this would just about complete my "the future, now" home media set up. Now how am going to manage all this media, as well as the existing broadcast stream and the self-generated content of my social sphere too? How will I discover new things?

How exactly do I stay attached to the social fabric mass media creates, without actually having to be slave to the broadcast stream?

Well for that we need an Uber-EPG...
