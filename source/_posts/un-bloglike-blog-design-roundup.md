I've always been quite interested by [The Register's](http://www.theregister.co.uk/) front page, although technically it's not a blog, but the new design of Gawker's [Sploid](http://www.sploid.com/) really pushes this approach out further. It does tend to smush into a big fog of headlines, pictures and captions though - maybe a little reinforcement of the grid would be better? _(see pic) hey... what do I know?_

Anyway, it got me having a look around a bit more - you know you really miss this stuff through a newsreader, I'm not sure there's any way round that - enforced custom CSS? Nah. Anyway, [Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/) is another almost-blog site I think works - yes it's noisy and brash, with big ads, but the ads are well sold with rich media, trailers in there and it has a strong community backing up each story, in some ways a lot of what I had hoped for the [London Line](http://www.thelondonline.co.uk/londonline/) site. 

Who else? We like [Stop Design](http://www.stopdesign.com/) \- great layout on the frontpage, lots of cute infomative graphic details - the posts are more typical though. [Jaketracey.com](http://jaketracey.com/) has a fairly standard 2 column page, but hey those tabs on the right are certainly cool - very, very slick. William Peng's [Bombast](http://bombast.org/) is a clever twist, reminds me of Matt Webb's [Interconnected](http://interconnected.org/home/) for some reason, but crikey, he's only 16. Respec. Or whatever the kids say these days...

More surfing and design picks later.
