Interesting to note from my browser stats (entirely unscientific, my own view) that MS Internet Explorer hits are dropping really rapidly. Maybe this is to do with the number of Apple switchers (yeah, right) or Firefox/Mozilla making an impact, but this is both good and bad news. Good news because it means we can all be good puppies and fully support web standards and earn our gold stars, etc. 

Bad news because it's going to create more work for designers and builders of sites. See, if 95% of your users are going to see the site in one (flawed but widespread) browser then the budget for cross-browser build and test and fix is understandably small. 

Now we are going to have to make sure it more than just scrapes by in other browsers. And I bet that budget doesn't go up much. But Paul, you cry, this is what we want! We want the enforcement of adoption of proper W3C standards. Yeah thats all very good, but **it doesn't work properly** and it still has to work in the (aforementioned flawed, buggy, box-model-broken) still biggest browser too. Pain in the arse, incoming I tell you.
