Well it [looks like](http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2004/03/20040328064523.shtml "Mac Rumors: 'Brilliant Savings' Promo") there's not going to be any medium sized updates to [Apples G5](http://www.apple.com/powermac/) now till July. I've been waiting for at least some revision before buying one, but its at the point of "need" now. My credit card is now on fire. Oh well. Happily, as it's _just_ sneaked in before 31st March, I should be able to include it all in my 100% first year allowance, [writing it off against profits for tax purposes.](http://www.bcentral.co.uk/finance/tax/ICTBenefit.asp) Which is nice.
