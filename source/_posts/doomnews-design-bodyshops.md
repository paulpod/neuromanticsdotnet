Got this email from a new media design recruitment and freelancer shop yesterday.

> To date \[agency\] has undertaken to pay you every four weeks provided you invoice us during that time frame.  Because several of our clients are taking much longer to pay us, \[agency\] will in future only be able to pay you once we have received the monies owed to us from our client with whom you have been temporarily employed on site.  I do assure you that once we receive these funds, we will pass them on to you promptly.  This decision has not been taken lightly, but is designed to safeguard the financial health of \[agency\] and, therefore, you, as a much valued candidate.

I haven't used them for probably a decade, so I doubt they have an up to date CV. Still good to see they are in business, although doing what now, it's hard to say. If you don't even get relieved of the risk of chasing clients for payment, seriously, what's the point?
