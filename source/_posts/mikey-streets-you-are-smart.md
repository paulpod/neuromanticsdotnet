Just been listening to the new The Streets album, and must say I haven't heard an album that stands out quite so much as a complete genius piece of work in a very very long time. It's got laughs, it's got fun and games, it's got Mike being a bit crap at getting the DVD back to the shop and phoning his mum, it's got tears and a beginning middle and end. Brilliant! You can just imagine after not getting the Mercury music prize a couple of years back thinking "right you bastards... "
