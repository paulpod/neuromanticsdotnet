So Mail worked second time round with an import of \*just\* my 2005 inbox sitting there quite happily. Will try adding more later. The new interface is slick, and the general feel of the app seems just more ... grown up I guess, from last time I tried switching from Entourage.

Dashboard is as expected really. The weather is very nicely displayed along with a 6 day forecast, which i used to pay for using weatherpop. The other services are (as sherlock before it) pretty US centric so don't work. It looks like we are going to have to rely on a strong UK coding community to make it as useful for us.

Downloading various apps and updates I've noticed Safari is a bit bloody jumpy, asking for confirmation when downloading anything that is an application. I understand it's a good security measure, but gets pretty annoying pretty quickly if you know what you are doing, and I can't find an off switch.

So after a bit of time I end up with a serious problem recurring from the previous 10.3.9 install I had going on - iTunes 4.7.1 is hanging on quit, and forcing me to do a hard reset. Except this time, the suspect (audioscrobbler) isn't installed! Hmmm... after poking about online, it seems iTunes and it's new iTunes Helper invisible app is to blame. Much system scrubbing later and a downgrade to iTunes 4.7 seems to work fine again.
