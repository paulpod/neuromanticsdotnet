Planning to make a great poster based on the entire collection of the "Now Thats What I Call Music _n_" series of pop compilations running all the way from 1981 to 1999 (there has been little of note since the end of last century - even the late 90's are getting a bit ropey). 

It'll be great with lots of slices of info-porn. You'll be able to chart the rises and falls of individual musical sub-genres, artists, labels, etc. 

It'll look great as a big A1 poster. What will be even better will be a huge interactive "Now..." explorer, complete with streaming snippets of tunes, links to sites, stores and stories. Oh yeah...
