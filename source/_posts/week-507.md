The long weekend was a joy, and although this isn't 'work', we did get round to scooping out about 9 frames of honey we'd taken from our bees earlier in the summer. The messy results of that sticky process are now sitting in a slowly filtering honey-bucket awaiting bottling in a few days.

After that, it was a new month, a new term and it feels like a new start. Having had hardly any EMI work to do this week I've been able to focus on the new startup. Now everyon is off holidays, we had a great catchup meeting on Thursday, with the whole team together. Awesome stuff, a few shifts in the various strands but overall momentum, which is invigorating.

Immediate tasks bubbled up with a pitch next week so Friday was spent putting some very quick screens for an iPhone app together and sketching out an iPad app. This weekend I'll flesh those out and should have nice work ready for midweek.

In addition, I've been helping out with a little site for the [New Forest Festival](http://newforestfestival.com), learning a bit more than I'd like to know about Wordpress. Really, I'm shocked by how popular WP is - it's a right messy old nightmare doing things in it. Back to MoveableType for me next time!

Busy busy busy!
