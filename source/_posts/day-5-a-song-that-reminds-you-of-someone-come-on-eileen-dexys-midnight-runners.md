This reminds me of my dad. It was released in the summer 1982 (so I'd be 8 years old) and I recall being at my nans and this song being on heavy radio play. I think my mum either hated it or had another favourite at the time and my dad was certain it was going to number one - they may even have had a little wager between them as it going to number one!

It did, and we had the album later that summer - I think bought with the winnings from the bet. Ah, I may have got all that wrong - I'll have to ask my dad - but even if the story is wrong this song still reminds me of him.
