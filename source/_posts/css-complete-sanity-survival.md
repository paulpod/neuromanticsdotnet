As may have been visibly obvious, I've been trying to get the layout of this site correctly balanced between my 4 test browsers while keeping the design as consistent as possible. My test browers are Win/IE6, Mac/Safari, Win/IE5, Mac/IE5 in order of importance. It's been an educational experience, akin to keeping plates spinning or sitting on a chair with a wobbly leg. 

Fixing one browser layout would break another; fix that another would fall apart; repeat until bored. So, I think I'm going to stop now and be a bit more zen about it. This article helped me see the divine light: [Digital Web Magazine - Keep It Simple: Keep CSS Simple](http://digital-web.com/columns/keepitsimple/keepitsimple_2003-11.shtml "Digital Web Magazine - Keep CSS Simple") via [Tom](http://www.plasticbag.org/)

> CSS hacks lull Web developers into a false sense of security and into pride at the complexity of their solutions, while the underlying theory predicts long-term disaster. Don't fall for these aberrations. **Keep CSS simple.**

Checking browser stats also calmed my endless paranoia too. Mac/IE5, you are so down my list of things to care about. Now, just need to nudge a couple of borders into the right place... I'm not obsessing, oh no... **update:** Fuck it. A two column table isn't going to hurt anyone. Zeldman does it.
