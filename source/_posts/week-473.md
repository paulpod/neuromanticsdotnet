Not the usual weeknote this week, seeing as I've only been able to do a couple of days of work. Monday was a hospital visit to check up following my heart valve replacement at the end of 2008. 

All is good, with dramatic remodeling of my heart so far resulting in a halving of the size of my distorted right ventricle. So yay that. 

Wednesday and thursday not so great, some noro-type stomach bug I guess - short but unpleasant, hey ho. So inbetween those things I've been looking at the amazing work and possibilities opened up for us on our future products by Processing.js which by all accounts is a marvel.

Considering we want to mash up high-end music experiences with all sorts of metadata, this might be a very tasty visual layer to add a degree of richness. Plus being completely open we can have a kind of developer API to all our products right off the bat. 

Awesome, awesome stuff. Hoping next week is a bit more normal - I'm actually in London overnight Thursday 18th too, so it might be nice to catch up with some people in the hoxton 'hood.
