A good week, i think, but this is late posted. Product dev churns onwards, I'm up to other projects too so those took priority this week a bit. 

It's simple wireframing of standardised 'bricks' (chunks of content, navigation elements, components, plugins, widgets, whatever) to use on a wide range of websites built using Wordpress. Not dull exactly, but just stuff that needs doing. 

On Thursday I attended the Music 4.5 conference, which was a mashup of music biz and tech startups. [Full coverage here](http://www.music4point5.com/blog/). It was really good, decent line up and well organised. Techcrunch had a Pitch segment there, which was interesting. One startup in particular caught my eye, [Decibel](http://decibel.net) who are aiming to create a metadata service, offering much more depth than the standard Gracenote artist/genre/year/album dataset. 

A big undertaking, but properly researched, maintained and API'd could be extremely useful to build advanced discovery services and connective tissue for music content.
