In the first post in this series I talked about getting a CD player, and how that ended up in 2025 being a CDJ. Here I talk about how it is also a digital media player, and the software it uses.

Why does a CD player need to be a soundcard over USB and why does it have ethernet? I think the simple answer is "Rekordbox".

I thought I had kept up with digital music player software over the ages. I remember typing in a program on my Dragon 32 that sampled sounds. But 32K isn't going to get you very far. That was followed by Sound trackers in the Amiga/Atari ST era, Winamp, Soundjam, iTunes, Zune, Spotify. I'd designed music products around a few of them even. But this was new to me.

## What's in the box?

The Rekordbox, specifically. I had never heard of it. 

Not _actually new_ of course. It has a [bit of a history](https://www.mixvibes.com/story), Mixvibes and Looptrax were sample playing music software apps in the 90s. Looptrax was a bit Albeton Live-ish I think. Mixvibes became a digital vinyl system, I don't recall it but the [first one was Stanton Final Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTd0hUxlp2A) which I do. 

Records with timecode controlling digital playback. Looked cool, but I've never used it. They continued to develop it and Pioneer DJ tapped Mixvibes in 2008 to build a digital media tool for their hardware, which they named Rekordbox.

## What does that do?

I guess building digital media playback off USB sticks into your CD players, you'd need a file-library tool? Exactly - at first glance, Rekordbox look similar to other digital music libraries - the big spreadsheet view of the library for titles, artists and other bits of metadata:

But it should be able to playback those files too, ideally with all the tools represented digitally that a set of decks and mixer provide.

So you'd normally have some buttons for a playback and progress bar, time/pitch stretching, looping and all that good stuff we found on our CDJ. Playing one track looks a bit like this:

{% raw %}
<video width="956" height="456" loop controls="true" playsinline poster="/images/1deck.jpg" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="/images/rekordbox-one-deck.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>

{% endraw %}

But it does more...

Here, you have multiple players represented - 2 or 4 decks - and instead of a simple progress bar, each deck has a big visual representation of the audio waveform moving past a static playback head, as well as the "spinning" playback head on the disc, and position of the playback along the current track. It is a lot!

{% raw %}
<video controls playsinline width="100%">
	<source src="/images/rekordbox-four-tracks.mp4" type='video/mp4' />
	
	Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>
{% endraw %}

In addition there is volume and eq for each track. That's a whole bunch of visual information representing the music, all at once and in one place. Let's break that down.

- Bar and beats scrolling timeline
- Waveform showing frequencies and volumes
- Position in the song
- Sections or "phrases" of the song
- Cue points

Loads of stuff, but the focus of attention is **the now** - the playhead, which the music, represented by the scrolling beats and waveform move across. 

With a second track lined up, you are looking ahead a few bars, you match the beats up of one tune to another.
