Well, ok probably not, but its local and might be a good piss-up: **The [UK Webloggers Xmas Party](http://www.funjunkie.co.uk/comments.cfm/article=07ce11b4-33e0-4746-a454-693bf9dc25bc "UK Webloggers Xmas Party")** is round the corner on Saturday. And of course we can discuss who will win the Guardian blog prizes. Yeah, right. But I did enter under best designed, so you never know your luck eh? I wonder if I should also vie for worst behaved blogger? Hehehe... Update: Didn't make it. Too worn out form the previous 24 hours of bad behaviour. One isn't as young or rich as one used to be...
