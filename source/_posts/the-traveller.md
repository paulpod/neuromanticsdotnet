Well that was an enjoyable read, although of course made me paranoid as fuck. Being at the Big Chill while reading it wouldn't help with that obviously and I read that the same weekend police were using facial scanning technology at V2005 over in Staffordshire. 

Brrr. But there's more: a nicely designed little online marketing/support campaign. Very nice. Or is it real? See, paranoid. Why not try starting [here](http://www.evergreen-foundation.com) or [here](http://www.geocities.com/judithstrand/).
