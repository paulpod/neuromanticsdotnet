There are a few feeds for this weblog. The one most useful is the [full text feed](http://www.neuromantics.net/bunker/rss2_full.xml) including all pix, plugins or other html gumph I throw in. Alternatively you can get the [Feedburner feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/bunker), which has my (little used) del.icio.us posts and flickr pix rolled in. A [headline only feed](http://www.neuromantics.net/bunker/rss2_index.xml) is available if that's your thing and the irregular, unreliable and illegal [mixtape podcast feed](http://www.neuromantics.net/neuropodcast.xml) is available updated monthly, if at all.
