Patchy week, far too much time consumed doing tiny, but multiple, changes to a couple of sites. 

There's a convoluted approval process for some release-projects here, so progress can be slow and frustrating, even with modern workflows like Basecamp (about which i'll write about in the future). 

Between bits of that, I'm making slow but steady progress exploring mobile UX angles of our embryonic 'digital deluxe' project, now codenamed Lava. 

Ongoing... A site I sketched out a month or so ago is live, the [revised EMI.com](http://emi.com) \- this is based on the [Basic Maths](http://www.subtraction.com/2009/11/14/introducing-basic-maths) wordpress theme, with some tweaks and custom plugins. For such a big name, it's quite a pared down site, basically a release blog, [artist roster](http://www.emimusic.com/artists/), press releases, that kind of thing. Having tried to be a flashy 'music destination' before without success this makes more sense. 

Fans head directly to the artist or fansites via search engines. Music discovery happens is [many](http://last.fm) [other](http://14tracks.com/) [ways](http://muxtape.com/), but ([almost](http://bleep.com)) never off a label site, especially a 'parent' label covering an incredibly diverse set of sub-brands. It'll be interesting to see how it goes. 

One last note, the [lovely guys at DUB](http://www.dubstudios.com/our-blog/) need a great freelance design/ux person to continue some initial redesign work I'd done with them. If you have the relevant skills and sparkle head over and present your wares.
