Sway
===

I've been working with Mike for a few years now on Sway. In 2016 in was conceived as a way to introduce people keen to broaden their reading on a political subject of the day, in return for a weightier vote in an opinion poll on said subject. There was a whole app for that, and people tried it out. We learnt some things, but it hasn't saved democracy or turned the tide of shit.

We've been noodling on an off with it for a while.

Some thoughts here to navigate to where we are now.

Part of the problem we were attempting to solve was that not all news sources are _good_ and on social media some news sources are actively _bad_ or worse. You can rank, check and flag content. So how about some way to see that ranking and flagging?

Another part of the problem is who is sharing these news stories with you. Within your direct network, you hopefully know and trust some of these people, but in the land of forwarded links, excitement can run ahead of fact and balance. 

So how about some way to map the people outside your network to see what else they think, what else they share, what else they say?

I had been thinking about moving the activity into a browser extension. Like Grammarly checks what you write, it would _check what you see_ and provide:

- background checks into who promotes what you are reading
- where what you are reading came from
- what other views that source holds
- suggestions for better/balanced/deeper things to read on the same subject
