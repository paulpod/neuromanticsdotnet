Spent some time housekeeping last week and updating softwares. I'm liking the new version of [Ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/) for blogging, the new [NetNewsWire](http://www.ranchero.com) for browsing, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) for photos, the new [Bit Torrent](http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/) for downloading. Dock Seperators are fantastic, but i can't find where i got them from. They are just 'empty' applications that you copy and rename and drag into the dock. Very cool.

The new phone (P900) is working nicely now, but syncing isn't the smooth path it should be. I don't use the Apple Mail, iCal and Address Book so getting Entourage to work with it needs a [couple of scripts](http://homepage.mac.com/WebObjects/FileSharing.woa/wa/default?sitefn=RootSite.xml&user=berkowit28&xmlfn=TKDocument.1.xml) but after that everything is great. The whole P900 - iSync thing works so well for me that I spent a good deal of time setting up Address Book properly (finally). That combined with the sheer brilliance of [Salling Clicker](http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/Clicker/) has made me almost like the phone. Almost - bloody awful buttons on the flip literally are useless.
