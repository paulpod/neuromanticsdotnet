This isn't new but Trent Reznor very kindly [released](http://nin.com/current/index.html) the fab latest single in garageband format. Well, I've seen lots of people commenting on how great this is (and PC users whinging about how hard it was to get it to work for them - like, whatever) but not many people releasing their own mixes \- my mistake, there are **500 of the things** and a competition over at [CJB.net](http://www.thtffanremixes.cjb.net/) \- so here's mine. Bertrand said it sounded a bit like Hybrid, which was very kind.

Much more fun to contribute than commentate I think. I'm guessing copyright on this track is pretty much slaughtered! thanks again Trent - much fun! 500 mixes... wow...
