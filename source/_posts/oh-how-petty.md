I mean really, how much of a sad git do you have to be to go to the length of complaining about a typically advertising claim such as Apple's Power Mac G5 claimed to be "the world's fastest, most powerful personal computer". Well duh, it's advertising. Do you think new Fritz really washes your clothes whiter than old Blutz? A whopping 8 viewers complained, Billy Gates fan boys each one. I assume Jack Schofield at the [Guardian](http://www.onlineblog.com/) was one? [Television Advertising Complaints Report](http://www.itc.org.uk/itc_publications/complaints_reports/advertising_complaints/show_complaint.asp?ad_complaint_id=930 "
