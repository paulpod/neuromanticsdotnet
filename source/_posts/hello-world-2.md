Well, we'll see how long this keeps up. It's been a long while since I did any blogging and in the intervening time a few things have happened which I shall mention once only, here: **Tioti** \- Started up a startup, got funded by angels and a VC, parted company from co-founder, got ill (see below) exited startup. **Being ill** \- Got bacterial endocarditis with multiple complications, nearly died, spent 3 months in hospital, received a replacement pulmonary heart valve, nearly died, mostly recovered now thank you. There, done. Next post, onto more happy things.
