Health - All fixed (in fact, slightly improved!) Business - Hotting up for the Autumn rush. As always, [calling all good freelancers](http://www.neuromantics.net/connect1.html), especially junior designers, illustrators and front end (including flash) developers. Romance - All good. That's all I'm saying about that. ;-) Music - Yes here it is, on time and a cracker - [September's Mixtape](http://neuromantics.net/mp3/). You won't find these is the shops folks!
