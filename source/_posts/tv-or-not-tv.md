I'm writing this after musing on doing something new. A startup maybe? I don't know what kind of thing yet, but I had [previously](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/apr/24/digitalmedia.broadcasting) done a startup [around online TV](http://neuromantics.net/portfolio/tioti-onepointone/index.html). 2006-2008 ... too early, probably. 

Anyway, now almost everyone watches TV on the internet almost all of the time. Is there a space for an aggregator of what's on, what's good, where to watch it? Probably. [I think people are doing it](https://reelgood.com), reasonably well, and the need is a bit niche. So I'll think of something else to do instead.
