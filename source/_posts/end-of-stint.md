Today ends my current contract with NHS Digital. It's been extended at the last minute but I'm going to take a little break anyway. I'm a bit out of juice. Over a year ago I jumped into a government contract, and at the end of that started at the NHS. 

It's been an interesting enough couple of projects, with some real delivery of services to people. But the travel is a bit random and constant, and none of the locations are exactly convenient. 

I feel a bit of a wimp to be honest, other people do much more travel, work much harder, take on much more responsibility. But. I feel entirely empty of creative spirit, ideas, energy. I need to tend to the farm and the woods a bit. Go on holiday. Sleep. Dream.
