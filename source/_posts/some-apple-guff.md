Long time, no updates. As usual it's been a combination of work and life pressures plus it is, like, summer you know? So, topically, let's hit on some Apple guff first. I did a whole _load_ of software updates as being at least a little wise, one _never_ updates or upgrades a working set up mid-project and we've just had a few wind up nicely. I think I skipped a few interim versions, but **iTunes 5** is the big one here.

New gradient UI hotness, we like, as do we like the podcasts feature now that there are [some half decent ones](http://www.psfk.com/files/podcastfeed.xml) around. Mixtapes essentially, god forbid I start listening to bedroom DJ types waffling on, christ. Can it handle .zip, .torrent or other podcast filetypes? Can it bugger. So you won't be getting [our hot new mixtape](http://neuromantics.net/neuropodcast.xml "RSS/podcast link to our mixtape") through it then - use iPodder or any RSS newsreader - still there's always the [usual download page](http://neuromantics.net/mp3 "Web link to our mixtape"). Go on get it, we'll wait.

Back? Great. Now I'm not sure if my ears are deceiving me, but the sound quality sounds a bit better to me. Could be wrong. So in addition to a big-ish new iTunes we get the iPod Nano... What? **It is a thing of beauty.** I do declare I want one very much, tape it to the back of a RAZR and it'd still be a better phone than the horrible ROKR thing they brought out the same day. I don't know, the fuss about this is very undeserving really - doesn't connect to the store, doesn't include any unique hardware synergy like a scroll-wheel or just... anything? Am I missing something? It's just an iPod like UI (except, not) to play iTMS DRM'd tunes on a phone? Phhht, care?
