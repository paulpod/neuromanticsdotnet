Awaiting formal timing and pricing from Danny for Project Bookworm, I've made a start on the design because I think I might get a bit busy.

At least that was the plan. Meeting the Project Tuneful client last week was very positive, they seem to have a plan to make buying access to additional content and experiences desirable. It should run across a collection of services, mostly third-party to begin with, and needs a unified, brilliant interface to delight these premium-level customers. I start next week, so in London more often than recently.

On another, er, note I bought a [new toy](http://livescribe.com) I'm hoping to use in anger for the first time on this next gig. A smart pen, which might just have become a mature technology finally - I remember seeing one at Jones' place in Helsinki and that was years ago. But then again, that was a tiny slice of nordic future (I seem to remember a Roomba there too!) so these things take time.
