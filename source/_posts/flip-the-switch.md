After a bit of a premature opening, I've spent the past couple of days mired in CSS cross-browser and OS fiddling about and the bunker is now open. "What's different?" you may ask - well you would if you looked at it on a mac. 

Discovered to my horror it looked pretty pants on windows. Bah! And it broke down \*very\* ungracefully in older, less well behaved browsers (I'm looking at you, Netscape). All fixed now though (well 99%) and really having mixed feelings about this CSS business. 

In theory fantastic, but the support is so flakey in parts that you end up doing the usual dodge and shuffle making changes and testing all the time. 

Wasn't this supposed to be a bright new dawn where we didn't have to use sneaky tricks and hacks? Bah! Still, I'm trying to stick to the _spirit_ of the new republic, but it's hard giving up your TD tags. Don't miss the spacer.gif's though - they were always a pain in the ass. **update:** _still_ wonky in win/ie5. arrrrrgh!
