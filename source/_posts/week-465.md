(Sitting here typing in my 10 year old Razorfish - Las Vegas '99 T-shirt, my how little things have changed) Pummeling possible interfaces into life is the fun part. 

The end of last week and most of this I've been imagining a couple of directions to explore that lets us accommodate all sorts of content possibilities for premium music products. 

Awesome you might think, but fiddlier than you'd expect. When the basics are understood, I like to sketch up things really roughly on screen - scanned scribbles, generic iconography and the odd touch to give things life. 

For experiences that are inherently interactive (rather than, say presentational or informational) It often makes sense to throw these together into something clickable in flash, just to get the feel of the piece. 

It's a bit of a straw-man in many respects - the trick is to keep everything extremely disposable, so no one gets attached to any execution at this stage. There should be a roughly skinned straw-prototype to click around by the end of this week for the first product. 

I expect it full of holes and glue, but ideal to rip up and refine, rinse and repeat. Also this week, I finally got round to trying the iPhone scrabble Words With Friends. It is good, the 'barely playing' pacing (if you want) is very interesting. It is also very good fun. Recommended.
