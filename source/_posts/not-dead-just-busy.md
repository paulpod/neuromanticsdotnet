Lack of updates for a while here... Terribly sorry, I've been engaged on FHM.com's redesign for the past few weeks, and will be for a while longer. In the meantime I'd like to point you towards the well written blog of my new business partner. It's sometimes about food and sometimes about the other things in his ker-azy life. [The Evil One](http://www.neuromantics.net/bert/) \- Blog about stuff. I need to do him a swanky redesign at some point. Time, just not enough of it and list of projects to do as long as your arm. Still, the gym's going well ;-)
