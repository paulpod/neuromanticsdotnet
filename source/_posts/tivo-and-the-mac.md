[TiVo and the Mac](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5504): MPEG extraction, networking and general hacking. I should be enjoying getting into this soon with new hard drive replacement (120gb) and a network card recently delivered. Just need to get on top of the currently recorded list ... not as easy at it sounds.
