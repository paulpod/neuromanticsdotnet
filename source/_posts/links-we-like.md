Nice weblog: [verseguru.com](http://verseguru.com/?weblog)

[37Signals](http://www.37signals.com/) are running an interesting [workshop](http://www.37signals.com/workshop-basecamp.php) on how they built [basecamp](http://www.basecampHQ.com/), their web based project management tool. I really want to use basecamp at some point. [Adaptive Path](http://www.adaptivepath.com/) are running one on [building Blogger](http://www.adaptivepath.com/events/2004/sfo/) too.

37Signals also have something a bit worrying - [37Express](http://www.37signals.com/express.php) \- a 7day turnaround, one page, faceless redesign service for Â£2500. This kind of commodity design could be the way it is going, and if true, might be something we look at.

[Red vs Blue](http://www.redvsblue.com/bloodgulch.shtml). Some people have far too much free time.
