Good start to the week, PlinkArt won the Education/Reference category in the Android Developer Competition, with a well deserved $100,000 prize! Nice work chaps!

The app is now available outside of the weird restrictions of the competition now - grab it off the Android Marketplace for free. I understand it will be available for other mobile platforms at some point too.

This week I started Project Tuneful too which I think I can safely (ie. vaguely) describe as a hybrid media/service/UX design job for a record company. After getting immersed in the brief it's now becoming clear it is going to be quite hard. That's good, time for a bit of a stretch I reckon.

Most importantly, it's going to be very real. Actual product on the shelves, early next year. Slightly terrifying. One other thing, a startup I did a little design for in May and STILL hasn't paid is also integrated into the project - should be an interesting meeting.
