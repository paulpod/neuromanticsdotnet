New look, new business, new site (in progress). [Neuromantics - Design and Digital Couture](http://www.neuromantics.net/ "Neuromantics - Design and Digital Couture"). This has kept me busy for a while already but will hopefully be a winner. 

A few notes: 
**We Heart Blogs.** As part of our process we're going to be very pro-blogging tools, using them as part of our working methods - with clients, with each other, and in some cases for delivery. 

**"About Us" - yeah?** Nah, all that standard conservative business language has got to go. We are in the process of writing our **Manifesto** based on some core beliefs. If you don't feel it, what's the point? 

**Transparency - Value for Money.** I hate that mytification of design that goes on, with a brief handed over, Mr Designer goes and hides behind a brick wall for a few weeks, returns with two pieces of paper. Now Pick One. We'll be replacing the brick wall with some glass I think. More, as they say, soon...
