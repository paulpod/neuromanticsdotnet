Still (almost) no internet here at Neuro towers, but light at the end of the horizon - a week or so to go apparently. Good grief, that'll be 4 months nearly, hilarious if we didn't need it for like, everything. 

Received a nice fat order of art supplies today, including 10 nice chunky canvases. I need to put something on the walls you see as it's awfully barren here still, and we'll see if anyone wants to buy any extra I end up with. You never know, could be a second career. 

Biz continues apace, especially with all the "digital futurist" types whooping up the international jet set conference circuit at the moment (jealous, moi?), we're hoovering up plenty of "show me the future, will i need to wear shades?" design strategy work while they're away. **You hear me? We're eating your lunch kids! Mwa-hahaha! ;-)** Oh, updated [website](http://www.neuromantics.net) too... ...and finally, this [Roomba](http://www.roomba.com) (rest assured one of these robot hoovers is on the shopping list) el cheapo rip off [RoboMaid](http://www.the-robo-maid.com/) "Sweeps your floor so you don't have to", however I think an even cheaper hamster powered one would work even better and supply exciting hamster based entertainment.
