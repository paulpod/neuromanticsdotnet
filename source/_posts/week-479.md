This week I had a day off across the middle of the week, it was great and I had a haircut. Work either side of the midweek is more calm before the storm, our monster offsite prototyping sprint over Easter. 

We want to have layers of data visualisations as additional content or even as interfaces to the mainstreams of content. I'd been putting together examples I liked, and received two glorious books to add to this. [Information Is Beautiful](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007294662/ref=oss_product) by David McCandless [Data Flow](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/3899552172/ref=oss_product). Really nice. 

A little userflow doc I sketched together straddled 3 pages, almost without thinking I added three dots, centred to the bottom of each, one filled the others in outline. UI style pagination signalling in print - seemed completely natural.

I like it, will use it again. As we use screens for more and more of our reading, it seems entirely reasonable to translate the visual cues from the screen and apply them to 'legacy formats' like paper.
