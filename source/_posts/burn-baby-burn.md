Now this completely surprised me today - essentially CNET has aquired MP3.com. This would be reasonable and logical were it to be as that reads. 

But in reality CNET is only buying the MP3.com name, I assume some staff and tech, and ditching the thriving musical community which currently makes up the site. Ever since MP3.com tried (cleverly I thought) to get around old world legal boundaries and introduce their space-shifting distributed CD collection they have been looking at some wway to leverage their brand. 

The space-shifting got legally stomped on, but undeterred they made a brilliant move for unsigned and hobby musicians. The wide ranging (and varying quality) of this has got to be seen as a 'good thing' and some musicians (including a friend of mine) actually made some money off this. Considering this is all ending, to be replaced with Yet Another DRM'd music service astonishes me. 

Does CNET not have the nouse to build an online music store? Of course they do. Do they really need the MP3.com brand name? Hardly - they aren't even going to be shifting MP3's. This rush by so many players to grab the non-existent prize of the ultimate music store is looking like Yet Another DotCom Mirage from here, with the opportunity to lose an awful lot of cash. 

While P2P works, evolves and grows and I can still rip a CD (even old school audio out to audio in) there will be music trading. Like I've said since 1997, "deal with it, build a model around it or die". **Links:** \[MP3.com\] [\[the reg\]](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/7/34009.html "The Register") [\[slashdot\]](http://slashdot.org/articles/03/11/14/1253257.shtml?tid=141&tid=188 "Slashdot")
