So I spent a fun few hours with Delicious Monsters' Library last night and this morning. Barcode scanning works a treat with the iSight camera (hint: turn the light on) and with the more international items in my collection it worked really well. Unfortunately it's currently tied to the US amazon database so some stuff wouldn't show up using the UPC code or using the ISBN would bring up the wrong pic. Annoying, but no biggie really. Here are some suggestions for making the whole thing better.

**Google** \- It'd be great to have right-click links to google search or more importantly for myself, google image search. I can usually find the right UK cover artworks for titles on google images and swap them over - be nice if this was linked in. Would also be nice to have google links to authors, titles as well as the amazon ones.

**International** \- Yeah I know, but the sooner the better - do UK first ;-) \- \- Fixed already. Nice.

**Format** \- The book thumbnail sizes are based on the hardback/paperback format. It'd be nice to be able to change these, especially to edit shape - big square design book formats coming up 'normal' shaped are wrong.

**Right Click** \- or rather, lack of - is this a deliberate UI decision? I'm not sure it's a good one.

**Export** \- be nice to be able to export as a web page or something? With custom templating? Maybe even auto sync with a site - or even a CMS like movable type? With links back to amazon? Yeah...

**Magazines** \- do it for my long lovely magazine obsession (specifically Wired, Creative Review, Wallpaper, Adbusters, New Scientist, Edge, there are more - embarrassed now) and you might as well name your price. Article indexes/content pages please!

All in all, pretty good for a version 1. Hint: Get it cheap, use a serial number from a competitor app with serial box
