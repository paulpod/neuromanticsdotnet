So precisely in time does this book position itself, it feels like it shouldn’t exist now. But in 1995 this was the cutting edge of graphic design, occurring at the frontline of pasteup and digital technique and rooted in cool California. 

Surfing! Rock and Roll! Skateboards! Of the deconstructed type and bulldozed technology so broadly showcased in Typography Now, this collection of Carson's work is finely tuned and on the whole much more successful. 

Two of the spreads here are burned into my mind, favourites for all time. Less well known are Carson's advertising layouts, Pepsi below and Nike in the book but I think these are at least as original and well resolved as the editorial work.
