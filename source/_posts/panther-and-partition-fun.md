After what seemed like a fraught and annoying early Panther (alright, OSX 10.3) experience running the gold master since early October I finally had to bite the bullet and do a complete reinstall. What prompted this was the erie death of \*all\* my Adobe applications after the seemingly innocent quicktime mpeg update. 

After a few days working on site for a client, in OS9, I realised as soon as I had the time it had to be fixed. Before that catastrophe however i had been running into frequent out of disk space errors, caused by panthers much more aggresive VM swapfile usage. 

This combined with my slightly faulty install of popshop always using the startup volume for scratch caused me to lose all my user prefs all the time (a side effect of running out of disk space for VM it seems - very annoying). 

Before starting from scratch I decided to do some reading around as I quite fancied the idea of putting my Users, Apps and Swap on separate partitions. Not too hard to do really, just a little command line and its done. Instructions from [www.macosxhints.com](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20021011053443661&query=partition+users). 

I'm still keeping a very careful eye on memory usage - i threw in a GB partition for Swap - but right now it seems pretty robust. I've done a few stress tests without it complaining too much, but the real challenge comes when using it in anger, so should get up to some new motion graphic stuff this weekend. Reports will follow.
