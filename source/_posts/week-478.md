I didn't do a weeknote last week. It got to Friday and I was a blank: weeknote block. Last week we had a big release, the second with an 'extra feature' product so I should have plenty to talk about except... except I don't. Because we didn't do it. It was a special case, with much more work than usual handled by the artist and their own design agency. We only saw it the day of release and while it wasn't terrible by any means, it was a bit disappointing. Good album tho, so hey. This week has been revisiting early work. Recording our process doing a couple of 'lite' products with third-parties seemed like a good idea, so I've been drawing up wireframes and layout advice for future product teams to shortcut what worked for us. I'm also revisiting the iconography I quickly put together at the start of the project. We've had a little feedback now, and spending a bit longer drawing a better "suite" of icons seems like good time spent ahead of our upcoming dev/fort powered prototype week. More about that, another time, but I'm quite excited about it.
