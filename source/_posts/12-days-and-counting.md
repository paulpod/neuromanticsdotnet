I've wanted something to keep track of all the (physical) content things I won for ages, especially books. I tried to do it on this site with a library hacked from movabletype vs amazon but it's a bit of a pain in the arse and basically i'm too lazy to do it properly.

Now Delicious Monster have released a bit more info, screengrabs and stuff about their barcode-scanning, iSight using, auto recommending, syncing jamboree of OSX goodness and its out in just under two weeks. Excellent. Let the lazyness continue!

...and 2lmc [don't like it](http://2lmc.org/spool/id/4590) already, so probably ace.
