Imagine a young impressionable graphic designer-in-training with the shiny new tools of the revolution being taught side-by-side with the old metal craft ways. 

This book proved irresistible. But nothing ages quite so badly as funky distressed typography, and, to be fair, much of the content in this book was on the borderline of good taste at the time. 

And so, once a prized document of the blazing trail feels like a slightly embarrassing relic of a more innocent, dumber age now. Oh well.
