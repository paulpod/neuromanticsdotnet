Well, as traffic goes through the roof, it would seem I came a noble second in the [Guardian Unlimited Weblog Awards](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/weblogs/story/0,14024,1108883,00.html "Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | The best of British blogging") today. That's awfully nice and I should make the most of it! First, a request to look at my CSS - [here you go](http://www.neuromantics.net/bunker/bunker_nu.css) but honestly its a bit messy and doesn't work 100% yet. But its almost there. 

In another coloured box most likely, if I can pick a colour I haven't used yet. Another plug is obviously for myself: internationally famous designer seeks work from mid-jan 2004, all the boxes ticked, click the [portfolio](http://www.neuromantics.net/portfolio) above to see. Ok, best post this and go and go to work and do more beautiful things. Christ, 900 visits by 9am. I now have stagefright, thanks.
