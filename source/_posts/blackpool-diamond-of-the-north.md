So there is yet another BBC TV series set in my home town of Blackpool. In recent years there has been "The Pleasure Beach" - awful real life characters exposed (i used to work there), the drama "Blackpool" which was great, if odd and now BBC3's Funland. These shows always upset me as to how they portray the town, all seediness, dark corners, twisted dealings and scum. It's pathetic.

The reality is much much worse...
