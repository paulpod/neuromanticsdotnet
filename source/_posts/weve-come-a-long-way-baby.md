I'm going to fold this into the "Big 10 Years At Large Post" later, but I thought it interesting to note that i've spent the evening watching half a season of a TV show (West Wing Season 6 - _Christopher Lloyd playing Lawrence Lessig? Great scott!_) that hasn't been shown yet in the UK, that has clearly been grabbed from a US Tivo digital tv recording device, copied to a PC, adverts stripped out, cleanly re-encoded and distributed through a global peer-to-peer broadband network and then streamed from my kick ass unix box to a thin client hooked up the TV. 10 years ago i had just started my first job at BT research labs and the coolest networked media I had seen was an animated GIF. Now _that's_ progress.* * Progress : the motto of my home town. heh.
