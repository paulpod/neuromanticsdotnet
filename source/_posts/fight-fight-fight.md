Good selection of viewpoints relating to breadcrumbs in web/interface design here : [Users don't care where they are @ clagnut/blog](http://www.clagnut.com/blog/308/ "Users don't care where they are | clagnut/blog") 

I hate them personally, especially when they aren't _true_ breadcrumbs. What I mean is, that a breadcrumb trail should reveal the path a user has taken to get to the current point within a site. However, all to often one is presented with a set of navigation markers revealing a sites structure and the current position within that, which is plain wrong. 

I don't care how the site is structured, I care where I have been. If the primary navigation is correctly presented and well designed there should be no need for the added secondary nav in a site-creator-centric viewpoint. Distracting and confusing.
