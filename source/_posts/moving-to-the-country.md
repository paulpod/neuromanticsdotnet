After about 2 years thinking about leaving London and relocating to somewhere more rural we finally did it. Here's some notes on the move and our first week. **The place** No we're not loaded and haven't bought anywhere - we are just renting. But what a difference in value - we've moved from a two bedroom ground floor flat (in a converted, slightly damp, victorian terrace, natch) to a three bedroom house cottage, with gardens and garage. Space! Stairs! Storage! Shed(s)! We're paying a good deal less in rent for this than we were for the flat. In fact, I reckon renting a similar place where we were in London would be over £2000/month. Apart from basic practicality, our charmless flat has been replaced by somewhere with light, space, green, quiet and charm in spades. Indeed, it even has a thatched roof if you like that kind of thing. It also, thankfully, isn't one of those cottages with quaint olde low beams that would (bump) brain me at every (bump) turn. Recently refurbished, quite modern, white and clean but is at least 18th century. The [manor next door](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63732#s2) is recorded in 1086. Old school, indeed. Here's a pic.

As it is, both of us are working at home most of the time now. In the old flat this had become a chore in itself, with the spare bedroom overtaken by [SortOutMyVisa](https://sortoutmyvisa.com) and a desk erected in the living room for my own work. The clash between our two working needs (V on the phone most of the time, me after quiet or concentrating with music) made this increasingly a problem. Now: we each have a room, V's has two desks, space for her business partner, filing cabinets and shelves in abundance. more later...
