I got given this one christmas while still at school, 1989, and completely devoured every inch. 

Rather than just being a straight art plate book, it is a complete (up to 1975-ish) working history with tales of  building stage sets, funky seating designs, album covers, logos, architecture. I didn't know better, so the idea of a single designer being able to span all those things seemed sensible – the aesthetic was consistent. 

My delight was complete when realising this was a reprint, and a sequel was also available right now too. To the shops, and the beginning of the design book addiction.
