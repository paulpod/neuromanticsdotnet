I vaguely like little bits of the Doors (Light My Fire is alright I suppose) and quite enjoyed the film with Val Kilmer, but never really saw the appeal of most of the music. And this in particular - for some reason this song just wrinkles me all wrong, the mixed up bits of tempo - slow, fast, slow, fast just makes me hate the drugged up hippie prince. You'd have to be pretty fucked up to dance to this remotely well at least.
