The week just passed in a blur of events. We reviewed our prototype, which may be held in a little too much reverence. I see why - we aren't a technology company, doing things like this looks risky or weird. 

It might have been better to spin it in music-speak, something like "working out some riffs" or "cutting a 4 track demo" perhaps. Anyway, it needs some changes, and additions, which will mostly be flat photoshop mockups pasted into 'dumb' pages I think. It was quite a chunk of work, and I didn't finish until Sunday evening. Meanwhile, a volcano erupted and clogged our skies with ash stopping flights. No problem thought I, not going anywhere. I'd ordered a brand new Macbook Pro on Tuesday but a little dealy wasn't a problem. And then my current laptop went \*poof\* and properly died. 

Arrgh! Suddenly the efficencies of mass transit and globalisation becomes quite important. It's now Monday evening finishing this post, still no sign of where UPS may actually have my package (maybe Cologne, maybe Shanghai) and tentative signs of flights resuming. Getting work done if fine (ancient G5 tower to the rescue) but I'm a lot less portable. Work is at a very specific desk. Â Laptops, I realise, are ace.
