Alright, got completely distracted today. Started out looking into making a [videocast thing](http://www.antisnottv.net/), ended up looking up [RSS-enclosure automation](http://brandon.fuller.name/archives/hacks/mtenclosures/) and then got around to upgrading _(and paying for, ahem, finally)_ to [Movable Type 3](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/). 

So having done backups of the blogs hosted here, I decided to hose them and start from scratch. Did a bit of design and got this far with the coding. Not bad for one day I reckon. Stuff to do: Extras column to include dynamic linking to my Delicious Library, Do a "what's on the TiVo" which i need a little help***** with (grab txt feed off tivo on the local network, FTP upload to server, repeat hourly), tape in a similar widget for the old iTunes playing, grab a Flickr stream I suppose while I'm at it... ***** Worked out how to use curl, ftp -u and cron didn't I. Clever me.
