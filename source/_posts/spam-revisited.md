Now this is just getting plain spooky, tucked at the bottom of a spam about becoming a Certified Minister to perform weddings and such (what? why?) was this little piece...

*But suppose, said Rob, that something important should happen while I'm asleep, or not looking at the box? I have called this a Record, replied the Demon, and such it really is, although I have shown you only such events as are in process of being recorded. By pressing this spring you may open the opposite cover of the box, where all events of importance that have occurred throughout the world during the previous twenty-four hours will appear before you in succession You may thus study them at your leisure The various scenes constitute a register of the world's history, and may be recalled to view as often as you desire. It's--it's like knowing everything, murmured Rob, deeply impressed for perhaps the first time in his life*

WTF???
