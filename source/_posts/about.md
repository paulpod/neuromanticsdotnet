Bunker is the notepad and technology sandbox of Paul Cleghorn AKA **paulpod**. Paul is a designer working and living in London, sometimes calling himself an Interactive Art Director and sometimes a Visual Strategist. At other times he's a geek and pixel monkey.

How It Works
------------

It is built using movabletype for the most part, and I use a separate blog for the images gallery which is served as a 'server side include' when you access the page. There's also a random php script which selects the random links in the left hand column. These links were scraped from a year or so's worth of the EC1Pride mailing list, which is a private community of friends/designers/idiots. The music feed is supplied via iTunes and Kung Tunes running on my laptop, so not always providing live updates, and is another static include. The books list uses a CGI perl script which pulls out ANSI/ISBN numbers from yet another blog and builds a page by polling amazon.com for title, author, image and link.
