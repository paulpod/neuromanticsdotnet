So I've been entirely swamped for most of this year, working a minimum of two freelance gigs at once while keeping tabs on and shepherding TIOTI in the gaps. It has been exhausting and I'm starting to feel it, the breathers I get when I'm actually on top of all the things going on are too infrequent. So it's time to get organised!

First thing is the hellish [.Mac](http://www.mac.com "Apple's .Mac") performance these past few months - Sync? You must be kidding. It's rubbish, and I do rely on iCal to plan as well as record billable days. But its not working, nightmare. After messing with .mac sync once again i'm going to give [MySync](http://www.mildmanneredjanitor.com/mysync/ "MySync - .mac services without apple's .mac servers") a whirl and report how that goes. I'm also going to try out OSX Leopard as that has entirely new syncing built in, and it's retro-fittable to Tiger too. Report will follow.

Ok, so that's my time, future and past, sorted. Next up, words and ideas. I'm trying out a few notetaking apps at the moment, to make sense of the far too much RSS surfing I do. [Omni Outliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/ "Omni Outliner") looks like the leader so far, but annoyed me by being seemingly unable to alphabetise a list of email addresses. [Yo Jimbo](http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/ "Yo Jimbo") looks good, has .Mac syncing of notes and deserves a more robust playing with. I'm also trying out [Sidenote](http://osx.iusethis.com/app/sidenote "Sidenote Desktop App") which sort of works for me but has a couple of bugs that have irked me already.

I'm going to give them all a week or two longer and see what works for me, but if anyone has suggestions, please tell.
