Continuing a theme I'm noticing, [Powazek](http://www.powazek.com/) has that fat bottom-of-page block of links/colophon/functions and archives I'm seeing around the place. 

I wonder if this is because getting this stuff is difficult to fit (and code) into a third column or that it's making sense for people to keep it at the bottom of the site? Why have it at all? I'm noticing a big 'intro' block at the top of blog front pages too, usually text only - [example](http://nokrev.com/) at nokrev.com. I have almost no opinion on that I guess.

And blimey... there are a lot of very dull entirely similar WordPress sites these days. I've heard the alphageeks have been singing it's praises, hence the recent mass adoption, but is it so bleeding hard to re-template? If so, why use it? Not terribly impressed kids.
