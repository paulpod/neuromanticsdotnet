This struck me as a really nice example of something I haven't seen done properly yet. Create your mix (from a great set of mutlitrack audio), save it and then proceed to see and listen to many other peoples mixes from around the world. Fabulous. 

Must remember to revisit the old razorfish soundlab source files and see if i have anything suitable to try this out with. If not, its a nice excuse to play with reason.
