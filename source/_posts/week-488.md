So [like Phil](http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/05/23/week361.php) I've had a lot of trouble getting back into Weeknotes after a holiday break. I tried doing the 30 Days Of Music which I will continue - just not right now.

I'm currently in a nice hotel room at the top on Nob hill in San Francisco. I arrived a week ago to continue work on a better digital music product, and this past week have been working with IDEO a bit. They wind down now and we shift to development with Pivotal Labs.

It's a bit nerve wracking, I'm not sure we're quite 'there' yet but we are a step or two forward from our prototype phase. The amount learned having built that is only now becoming clear to me and it's been a big help deciding what is interesting and what is fun, rather than being dry and dusty about the whole thing. Users are not archivists, old records are not data.

Being Sunday I took some time away from work to enjoy sunshine, Blackpool winning their Premiership playoff and the Maker Faire here in SF. I can haz arduino, finally. The week ahead should be lots more work, not sure if it'll be fun, but have a feeling it will be decisive.
