I must have stumbled across these adorable paintings in 2013, maybe on a Tumblr or Pinterest. I liked them enough to buy a calendar. 

They depict the open spaces outside small town Sweden, with the air of a 70s and 80s freerange childhood. In 1954 the Swedish government ordered the construction of the world's largest particle accelerator, completed in 1969. 

The pastoral scenes show the decay of the once mighty industry, alongside such other remembered Swedish icons like Volvos, farmhouses and the occasional dinosaur.

Utterly charming, we get 125+ pages with paintings alongside half remembered childhood stories. It's on Amazon: [Tales from the Loop](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1624650392/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1624650392&linkCode=as2&tag=neuromantics-21)![](http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=neuromantics-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1624650392)
