My friend Celia has been running a secret blog for a while now, which has morphed into mostly a photographic diary using her wicked[Canon Digital SLR](http://www.canoneos.com/digitalrebel/) (digital rebel indeed...). It's looking really good and the photos are ace. I particularly like the glass ones, but thats me and my obsession with refracting light... Go Look - [Secret Blog](http://celia.typepad.com/secret/)
