This changes, and when I was younger was whatever I was into that week. Now with the benefit of time, age and a hint of LastFm I've narrowed it down to one. **[True Faith - New Order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Faith_(song))**  I remember seeing it, with the video, on the TV in 1987. No doubt it was the Chart Show or maybe even something specifically Granada where Tony Wilson was a regular TV face, presenting the local news. I didn't know he was also owner of Factory records and all that at the time. I'd liked Blue Monday but this was something else.

It hit me between the eyes stomping along (echoes of glitterbeat?) demanding your complete attention right through the enigmatic verse, throbbing bassline, stardust sprinkled chorus, extended middle eight and fading out with Hooky playing all over the upper ranges. Magnificent, a song that puts a bounce in your step, puffs out your chest and makes you think, just for a few minutes, that anything is possible. That's my favourite song.
