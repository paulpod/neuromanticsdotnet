A tiny wee book, roughly around 1999 – no copyright or ISBN so I guess made for clients, guests and friends and not usually for sale. 

I can't find much about it, a rarity. It's filled with around 100 pages of some iconic brands, and a few that are, _er..._ a little of their time, the [Metreon](http://www.westfield.com/metreon) brand for example. Lovely little book though.

This seems to pop up quite often and relatively cheaply [on Amazon used](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B007BF8694/?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&condition=all&creative=19450&linkCode=ur2&tag=neuromantics-21), so maybe not that rare?
