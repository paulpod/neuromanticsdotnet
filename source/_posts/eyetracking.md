I was thinking about eyetracking yesterday anyway, then came across this link today: [Eyetrack III - What You Most Need to Know](http://www.poynterextra.org/eyetrack2004/main.htm "Eyetrack III - What You Most Need to Know") Most interesting, and a few surprises in there too. 

The underlined headline/link being a turn off to sub copy below being a lightbulb for myself. Related to this, I'm idly beginning a Bunker site redesign over the next few weeks, along with integrating it into a more comprehensive [neuromantics.net](http://www.neuromantics.net) which can finally start releasing more information on what we are up to. PR and all that kids.
