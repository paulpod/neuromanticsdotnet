It's been a good week so far, if busy and a little fragmented. I'm due to be getting a chunky bit of design completed describing the main elements of the project I'm working on. 

I did a sprint last week to so an applied example to a specific product, now I'm wireframing up a generic "enhanced" product with very broad visual cues of how it could be presented. 

I don't think we're going to be massively tough enforcing the presentation layer but it's good to have a strong vanilla framework to fall back on in cases where time or resources get squeezed. 

We have a product suite which this stuff falls into the top end of, so another little task is to better define visual language across this suite - product labels that can describe the scope and depth of the experience while feeling solid when presented together, each one dipping into a bag of icons describing specific features. 

This is primarily a graphics job, and I'm probably not the best person to do it but do need to get an hour to write the brief. Also on my plate is a much pared down homepage for the main company site, which isn't as big a deal as you may imagine. What we end up doing with it may surprise a few people by it's simplicity but it makes sense. And it will be very very clean as I'm hoping to base it on the excellent [Basic Maths](http://www.subtraction.com/2009/11/14/introducing-basic-maths) theme by Khoi Vinh which should also condense development time significantly.
