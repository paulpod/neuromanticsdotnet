_(they're all at it, so I'm going to try it...)_ ![projectmango](/wpimages/uploads/2009/11/projectmango-150x150.jpg "projectmango") Back from @mik3yb's stag and barely able to think, I completed the last changes to some reworking of admin interface screens of the Project Mango user research platform and delivered layered photoshop files. 

A difficult project by being rearranging existing webUI parts into a more usable whole without starting from fundamentals. Project Bookworm remains about to start, basic outline wireframe and scope being more tightly defined to stop feature creep. 

To work well, it should be as simple as possible I feel. Extra fluff would be best added when the destination has been proven. Project Tuneful is working out as UX for a digital boxset prototype, framework and live job. It remains elusive in the background - we shall see. 

Which means ducking out of another gig, partly because it was going to be struggle to fit in quality time for the first sub-project and partly because it wasn't quite pushing my buttons. 

The scope seems limited at this point, so meaningful changes would be unlikely, more deckchair rearranging. On the horizon, voting in the Android Developer Competition ends next week - download and vote for [Plink Art](http://www.plinkart.com/) \- it's brilliant.
