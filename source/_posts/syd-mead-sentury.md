Less good this one with pretty lightweight text but great products, interiors and giant tractors. Pretty heavy on the giant tractors actually, with a large number of casino and resort concepts at the other end of the whimsy spectrum. 

Videogame work is included too, but feels less well resolved than the movie and vehicle designs. Also included here, the ugliest sofa known to mankind.

Used copies fetch [silly prices on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0929463099/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0929463099&linkCode=as2&tag=neuromantics-21 "Amazon UK") for some reason.
