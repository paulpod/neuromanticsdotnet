Right, I'm going to end up in a whole load of peoples bad books for saying this, but will you designers/css geeks stop trying to fix the world for free. Another recent example over at [Leaves Rustle](http://leavesrustle.com/articles/122/ "Leaves Rustle - Pilfered") tells the story of being ripped off (blah, whatever) but sees nothing wrong with the approach. There's been quite a lot of this activity this year, and from what I gather has not been a silky smooth process. The two sides of the fence are equally unprofessional and demeaning to our profession. Firstly you have the clients who whine they have no budget to do a CSS redesign, can't justify the ROI, can you do it as a favour, and put a wee credit on the site, be good for business, etc. That just leaves a nasty taste in the mouth - if it's not giving a good ROI then **don't do it**, at least not now, fix it on your next round of a proper redesign. Then we have the "because it can be done" school of designers spending some time un-tabling and up-cssing a site _unasked, on spec and uninvited_ in some sort of holier-than-thou pissing contest. Yes we know its a "good thing", but so is being polite and not offending the earlier efforts of hardworking people in the process. Plus, at the end of the day you come off looking not like the good css fairy delivering standards shaped gifts, but a desperate, naive, underemployed unprofessional obsessive. bah. rant over...
