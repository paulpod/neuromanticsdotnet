Tomorrow, April 1st (arf!), apparently we will be getting a phone line and broadband installed. Email will finally work properly and when required again, 

I'll be able to get organised again with online banks, synced email, address books, calendars, backups, photos - you name it. I will no longer be a slave to broadcast media as my TiVo will work again, as will podcasting and P2Pware. Might even start blogging properly again ;-) Oh Happy Day!
