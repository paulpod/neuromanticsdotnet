Just trying it out for now as an alternative method of disseminating our monthly mixtapes, but you'll be awfully glad to hear I'm not planning on recording some god-awful talk radio show. An invisible, background, underground, decentralised music distribution system **YES!** Wittering geekery about pretty much nothing **NO**

Seriously, most people are using it to make teeth-grindingly tedious "talk radio" shows available over the interweb. I'm using it as more of a "push" medium for my monthly mixtapes - it should just arrive on your iPod around the turn of the month, rather than that great schlep to download, import, etc. Now \*that\* is going to huge.
