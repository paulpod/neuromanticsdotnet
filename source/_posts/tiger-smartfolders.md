I was a little worried that I wouldn't find a use for these, being so fantastically organised... \*snigger\*

Turns out it was really obvious - have a smart folder for "recent work" which contains files opened in the past couple of days from my /Data/Work directory, and /Documents directory.

Useful to find stuff, obviously, a neat way to handle back-ups (mirroring in effect) of the most important files right now so even a hard drive crash would lose **zero work.** Live updates of what's there is nice but the choice part is the visual search for images. The little play arrow in the blue divider activates a screensaver type mode and makes available new controls for thumbnails, next, back, play slideshow, etc. Very handy, very swish.

Now if only Photoshop CS would actually open the files doubleclicked from the finder... hmmm, broken.
