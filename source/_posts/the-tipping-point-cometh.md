[iPod dominates teenage mindshare, market share](http://www.macminute.com/2004/10/06/ipod-teens/)

_Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said today that based on a survey of 600 teenagers, Apple's iPod is dominating "mindshare and market share." Munster said in a research note provided to MacMinute that of all the high school students surveyed, 16 percent currently own an iPod and 24 percent plan to buy an iPod within the next year. Munster also noted that the iPod ranked fourth on the teens' holiday wish list--behind clothes, money, and a car--**even though the iPod was not an answer option and had to be written in as a response.**_

Plus the whole Steve Ballmer "the most common format of music on an iPod is '[stolen](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/04/ballmer_ipod_thieves/)'" blatant PR "[casual comment](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/07/ballmer_doesnt_get_it/)". Plus the BPI claiming to [sue 28 filesharers](http://2lmc.org/spool/id/4578) but _doesn't know who they are yet_. Plus [podcasting](http://www.ipodder.org/) getting [jiggy](http://www.neuromantics.net/neuropodcast.xml) with it. Plus this [leak](http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0410photoipod.html) of the next iPod - colour screen and iPhoto support on a 60GB drive. 

All in one week? Matt put it rather well yesterday, that at some point it becomes more economically desirable to embrace change than support the status quo. This moment is referred to as the [tipping point](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tipping+point%22+music+industry&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)... (there followed some analogy about boats in water, but i didn't really get that, or was distracted by cute waitresses). **Listening to: They Suffocate At Night** from the album "Masters Of The Universe" by [Pulp](http://www.google.com/search?q=Pulp)
