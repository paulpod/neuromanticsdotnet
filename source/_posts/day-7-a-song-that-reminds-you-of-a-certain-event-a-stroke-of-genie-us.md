I'm not very cool, I rarely keep up with the trends but for a brief moment in 2001 I felt quite close to the new "thing".

The thing was mashups/bootlegs and the one that tipped me over the edge was this one by Freelance Hellraiser - A Stroke Of Genie-us with bits from The Strokes Vs Christina Aguilera. Here's a photo (not mine) from the what seemed like the smallest, hottest, most important club for all of 2 hours- King Of The Boots!
