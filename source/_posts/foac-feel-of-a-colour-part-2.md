Here's a rather simple example broadly outlining the requirements, benefits and outcomes of using a colour/context/emotion management and metadata dataset like 'Feel Of A Colour'. [Click for PDF.](/images/FOAC_example1.pdf) 

A paraphrased quote, originally from the [Pantone](http://www.pantone.com/products/products.asp?idArticle=114&idArea=16) website seems appropriate: _By using Feel Of A Colour, designers might one day be confident that their output will match their expectations._ 

Also recently got a first reference to FOAC in a great article about related issues, the transmissions of feeling, intention, etc. Read at [Anti-Mega.](http://undergroundlondon.com/antimega/archives/000771.html) Part one of FOAC [was here.](/lists_colours_semantics_oh_my.shtml)
