This [excellent piece](http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/default.asp#1111200389) expands on thoughts I've been having about Tivo for a while now. Essentially looking at the Tivo-enhanced TV experience from a three year olds viewpoint, who has never known TV without it. 

I had the experience of watching TV for pretty much the first time in a year _sans-tivo_ over xmas. It was alarming. The number of adverts, the shackles of the schedule weighing heavy, the general **couch-potato-ness** of it all (although that could be my sedentary parents - also a scary thing to witness). 

Most shockingly the sheer amount of complete crap you watch simply because _it's on_. Never again... I just wish Tivo would sort out a Series 2 UK partner, or even better get that newly announced HDTV Tivo (with 4 tuners!) over here quicksmart. (For what it's worth, sky+ != tivo) Found via [foe romeo: Growing up with TiVo](http://foe.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/this_tv_is_brok.html "foe romeo: Growing up with TiVo")
