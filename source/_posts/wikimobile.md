Note to self: Investigate downloading the entire [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and putting it on a phone. It should be fairly simple? Someone must have written a wiki engine for Series 60?

Added notes: Ah-ha, [Python is out for UIQ](http://feetup.org/blog/dev/python), so getting there. WikiLite mentioned on that page runs at 25 lines of Python code.

Also: An [RSS reader for P900](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/mfr). Another [one](http://my-symbian.com/uiq/applications/applications.php?fldAuto=881&faq=6).
