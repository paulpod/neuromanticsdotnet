Playing with my PSP today and noticed the menu interface had changed colour to green! I'm like, WTF? Turns out it changes colour every month, May is green:

> The order is: 1 Silver, 2 Yellow, 3 Lime, 4 Pink, 5 Green, 6 Light Purple, 7 Light-Blue, 8 Blue, 9 Purple, 10 Gold, 11 Brown, and 12 Red.

I haven't decided if I like that yet, but it is just another example of the sheer thought that goes into the design of things from Japan. We are learning, but not fast enough...
