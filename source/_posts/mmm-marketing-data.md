But really, if we knew like Tom asks, ["How many weblogs are there in the UK?"](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/12/how_many_weblogs_are_there_in_the_uk.shtml "plasticbag.org | weblog | How many weblogs are there in the UK?") it would be great to have some idea about what kind of linked up freaky population we have here. If it is indeed large, healthy and growing then we can start having some fun. I'm certainly not meaning evil advertising agency subverting the good of humanity for one more sale type fun. Oh yeah, I am actually. But in a good way.
