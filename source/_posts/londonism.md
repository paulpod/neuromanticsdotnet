Apart from the obvious (i'm fine, sister is fine, etc) I can't really beat these comments on yesterday's terrorist attacks, except to add that ID cards would clearly not have helped in any way and yet we still push forward - sign the [pledge](http://www.pledgebank.com/refuse/) to refuse.

  
Just because. [The London News Review](http://www.lnreview.co.uk/news/005167.php):

> What the fuck do you think you're doing?  
>   
> This is London. We've dealt with your sort before. You don't try and pull this on us.

  

> It's hard to panic the British. They've dealt with the Blitz, the IRA, the Silurians, the Zarbi, the Daleks, the Cybermen...
