I'm restarting weeknotes! I stopped because I was working on exciting new stuff for our startup, but we were having to be a tiny bit quiet about things and i was bound to say too much. I dislike the 'stealth' term for startups, because we are not ninjas or bombers. But sometimes you do have to be a little bit discrete about things, for a short time at least. The last posts were talking about developing our logo, but without revealing the end result it felt a bit pointless. So, a pause. Now, we're beginning to emerge blinking into the sunlight. Days are feeling _large_, the office is buzzing and filling up rapidly. We have done a ton of work in a few different directions (too many at once? Hmm - almost...) but we're almost there with a _one-point-oh_. Beta. We have data, we have a website, we have a publishing platform. We have a lot to do. So not to leave it hanging, [here's a developer Â job ad, on githubjobs.](http://jobs.github.com/positions/c5ebdc4c-23ed-11e0-8cc4-8326d0645800 "Artfinder Job Ad") And here's a logo or two. \[caption id="attachment_294" align="alignnone" width="277" caption="Artfinder logos"\][![Arfinder logos](/wpimages/2011/01/artfinder-logos-for-blog.jpg "artfinder-logos-for-blog")](/wpimages/2011/01/artfinder-logos-for-blog.jpg)\[/caption\] Left we have a reactive logo, that uses colour frequency analysis of your recently viewed content to visualise 'your' logo. On the right we have the vanilla. Enough revealed for this week. More, next.
