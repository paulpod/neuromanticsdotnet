Well, now we're starting to notice some of the smaller things about this release things become clearer. There isn't much \*POW\* as the release of Panther that's for sure - everything is about polishing surfaces and sharpening the edges up here.

Little things like the very small subtle noises in the finder - when a copy completes for example there is a light 'ting' - you might not notice straight away but are welcome. I'm not completely sure, but the anti-aliasing looks cleaner and sharper.

The Preview app now allows annotations with sticky-style text boxes or red marker style ovals. Very useful as Adobe Acrobat Reader takes the best part of a week to launch these days, _and that's before they integrate Flash_.

Issues? Always a few along the way. I needed to reinstall a driver for my Emagic 2|6 box, even after initially it worked ok - it disappeared after the iTunes [guff](http://www.neuromantics.net/bunker/arc/technology/tiger_install_diary_2.shtml#more) yesterday. Also Energy Saver isn't kicking in and sleeping my screens, which is a bit annoying. I'm sure there's a simple fix for that eluding me.

Poking around the Dashboard Widgets [documentation](http://developer.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html) has got me interested in building a TiVo monitor widget first, with the potential for much more interesting and expansive experiments later as it supports web plugins - so re-purposing a Shockwave movie may well be possible really easily. Excellent!
