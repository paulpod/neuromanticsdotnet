hi After only a few more normal type words (BEEN, THEY, WORK around 500 - 450) we suddenly hit our first indication that this is no ordinary mailing list. Thatâ€™s right, FUCK comes in at an impressive 425, slightly ahead of NICE (418) and SHE (415). To add to this, I thought It wise to take into account the following relations: FUCKING (373) FACKIN (109) FUCKED (99) FUCKIN (62) FUK (49) FUCKS (32) FUCKERS (31) FUCKER (18) FOOKING (18) FOOKIN (17) FOOKED (15) ..and one immortal FUCKCUNTSHITSOUPWANKER ... Soup?? Grand total... Over 1200, up there with the likes of AS and IF. IMPRESSIVE (22)....
