A zinger this morning from [Gaping Void](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001558.html): _There can be no technological solution without a cultural solution. Cultural solutions are more valuable and profitable than technological solutions. This got me thinking to a recent conversation I had with the Chief Marketing Officer of probably the most respected and "creative" ad agency on the planet. He told me:_

> Our best ideas no longer come from the copywriters. They're coming from the techies.

Which is an interesting point of view considering I saw this yesterday [over at O'Reilly](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/04/designing_from.html) neatly summed up as "Are designers the new heroes of the computer industry?" \[via del.icio.us/blackbeltjones\] Maybe it's just that we're all techies now?
