God, this is so 'Bloggie' and I hate it but this is for my own notes so I'll have to deal with it. Recent sites I am liking very much. [The Hidden Persuader](http://www.thehiddenpersuader-english.blogspot.com/ "The Hidden Persuader inEnglish") Ace blog and resource on advertising. [Now That's What I Call Music](http://www.nowmusic.com "Now That's What I Call Music") Oh, I'm so gonna scrape your XML. Oh yes I am. [Defective Yeti](http://www.defectiveyeti.com/ "defective yeti") Have I mentioned this before? Probably my favourite blog read. Matthew is very funny. [The UK Tivo Community](http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/forumdisplay.php?s=4699a7fe6d7cf7e1c07ca2e54773a917&forumid=14) Has saved my ass (ok, my tivo) more than a couple of times. Top quality geeks. [Mac Serial Junkie](http://www.macserialjunkie.com/) Enough said about that, the better. Er... that'll do for now. May edit later.
