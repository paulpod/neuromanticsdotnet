It keeps echoing around my empty, hungover brain... selling pop videos... selling pop videos... selling pop videos... but the spark isn't igniting. I feel like Homer Simpson in the one about the union ... lisa needs braces... dental plan... lisa needs braces... dental plan... lisa needs braces... i'm sure it'll come to me. (I'll not be installing 4.8 for a bit tho after my nightmare last time - does it still install the hated "itunes helper" anyone?)
