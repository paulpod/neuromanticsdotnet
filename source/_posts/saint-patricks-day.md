Feeling a little happier with my lot, I did a little photo montage from around Clerkenwell this morning : [Things That Are Green](http://www.neuromantics.net/temp/green.jpg "Things That Are Green") 1) Spray marked road builders symbols next to moss 2) Vibrant plant leaves 3) Graffiti stick man on green tile wall 4) Fiat car body 5) Towel drying on our antiquated clothes hanger 6) Plastic water bottle in the window 7) "Smokeing is good" graffiti on the kids playspace sign All up for a pint of the black stuff later? Excellent!
