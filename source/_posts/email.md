This prototype email client from IBM Research is very interesting indeed - [Remail: Reinventing Email](http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/sources.html "Remail Website")

> Remail supports multiple message sources of diverse protocols, allowing users to aggregate items of interest into a single in-box. These sources include email (Lotus Notes, POP3, IMAP) and group discussion spaces (Quickplace, NNTP). **Remail can also poll RSS feeds**, receiving information from news sites, blogs, wikis, CVS repositories, and any other system capable of publishing updates in this standard format. _(my emphasis)_

This looks particularly interesting as my particular behaviour has grown into a check email, check feeds routine more and more over recent months. Integrating these into a cohesive info flow seems like a natural progression towards complete info-addiction. In a good way, but yeah, I'm certainly feeling that creeping up on me.
