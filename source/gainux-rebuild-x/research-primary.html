	<p><strong>What attracts people to online trading</strong>
	<ul class="inline" style="margin-bottom:2em">
		<li>Making money is overwhelmingly the main reason people are attracted to trading</li>
		<li>Hope for bigger and quicker returns that investing</li>
		<li>Freedom, challenge, excitement and image are emotional benefits for many</li>
		<li>Often events and circumstances attract people to trading (e.g. VW Scandal, possibility of Brexit)</li>
		<li>Trading volume correlates with market volatility</li>
		<li>For many the decision to trade is on impulse</li>
		<li>Low rate of conversion from demo to live trading</li>
	</ul></p>

<p><strong>Common characteristics of online traders</strong>
<ul class="inline" style="margin-bottom:2em">
  <li>Overwhelmingly male</li>
  <li>Comfortable with risk </li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Differences between groups of traders</strong>
<ul class="inline" style="margin-bottom:2em">
  <li>Traders differ with respect to: experience, competence, attitude to risk, fundamental v. technical, financial resources</li>
  <li>Many young men see it as a chance to make easy money and get rich quick (‘Wolf of Wall Street’ Attitude)</li>
  <li>Older people tend to be more systematic and cautious</li>
  <li>Younger people usually more tech savvy</li>
  <li>Women more risk adverse than men</li>
  <li>Difference between those who know about trading and those just taking a punt</li>
  <li>Two kinds of novices: those who are new to online trading and those who are new to trading as a whole</li>
  <li>Some do training before trading some don’t</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Factors that have biggest influence on how happy/unhappy people are when trading</strong>
<ul class="inline" style="margin-bottom:2em">
  <li>Whether they are making a profit is by far the biggest issue</li>
  <li>Platform usability</li>
  <li>Platform stability and reliability</li>
  <li>Quality of tools provided (e.g. charts, new)</li>
  <li>Quality of client services</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Why people lose money</strong>
<ul class="inline" style="margin-bottom:2em">
  <li>Don’t understand risk management</li>
  <li>Get the direction right but run wrong</li>
  <li>Lack strategy and try and pick top and bottom of the market</li>
  <li>Rush to get going without education first</li>
  <li>Think it will be easy money</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Biggest opportunities</strong>
<ul class="inline" style="margin-bottom:2em">
  <li>Attracting Millennials</li>
  <li>Switchers are high value because they trade regularly and need less help</li>
  <li>Mobile is the fastest growing area</li>
  <li>Social trading</li>
  <li>Help clients trade more successfully</li>
</ul></p>
