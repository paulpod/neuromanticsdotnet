PAUL POD CURRICULUM VITÆ – 2024
Introduction

Designer of three of the most used online public services: NHS 111, Tax your vehicle, and Check MOT history, each with tens of millions of users probably including you.

Most recently I was a contract interaction designer with Defra / Environment agency, and before that I was at the NHS as interaction designer with the product team on the 111 online service.

Through COVID and the aftermath it was a hectic and demanding role. That was my second tour of duty with NHS Digital, and right before that I was designing a mobile app for start-up crowdfunder Seedrs.

Previously I worked on a range of innovation projects at Telefonica Digital covering mobile, internet of things, retail and other curious subjects. I’ve also done a range of design roles at startups and larger organisations.

With my own startups, Artfinder and TIOTI.com, I was co-founder and took an idea from sketch through prototype, into production through launch and beyond. Both receiving angel round funding at first, following up with a successful series A VC funded round. Tioti was acquired by Vizimo in 2008, Artfinder continues today. 

GOV.UK, GDS and NHS digital experience, also open to designing non-gov related products, services and also music tech / startup curious.

Makes prototypes: I prefer making things to drawing pictures of things. Variety over specialism. Quick and dirty over finished and polished. Learn. Repeat. Learn. Repeat. This is what Design means in agile.
